# title: Assessing the effects of temperature on backswimmer development and dispersal
author: Nicole Regimbal


## Course work for CIEE Productivity and Reproducibility 2025

This project uses data from a temperature manipulative experiment to determine the effects of temperature on backswimmer (*Notonecta undulata*) development and dispersal. 

## Study system

Backswimmers are semi-aquatic insects that fly to disperse between patches of freshwater habitats. They have 5 developmental instars before molting into an adult. Dispersal is energentically intensive for backswimmers, this relies on good body condition. 

## Aims

Rising temperatures associated with climate change are affecting species fitness and movement in a variety of ways. Temperature can affect the dispersal ability (physical and physiological capacity for dispersal) through changes to body condition and development. Understanding the impacts of temperature on fitness will provide insight into how this important freshwater predator may persist in environments. 

#What you'll find

This project contains the original dataset from the experiment in the 00_rawdata folder. A revised version of the dataset that is used in the data analysis can be found in the 02_outdata folder. Both folders contain data dictionaries with descriptions for all column names included in the files. 

The impacts of temperature on development and on dispersal are assessed in separate R scripts in the 01_scripts folder. Figures from the analyses are output into the 03_figs folder. 

Please find the pre-registration for this project in the 04_preregistration folder. 

The manuscript as both a markdown file and a pdf and a references .bib file can be found in the 05_markdown folder.
