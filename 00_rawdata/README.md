This project uses the raw data file "backswimmer_development_dispersal.csv" for all analyses. 

Please see the Data Dictionary for a description of all columns in the dataset. 

The R script "Setuo_DataCleanup.R" in the folder 01_scripts cleans this data for the analyses and outputs it in the 02_outdata folder.
