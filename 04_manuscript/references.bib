  abstract = {We surveyed 807 researchers (494 ecologists and 313 evolutionary biologists) about their use of Questionable Research Practices (QRPs), including cherry picking statistically significant results, p hacking, and hypothesising after the results are known (HARKing). We also asked them to estimate the proportion of their colleagues that use each of these QRPs. Several of the QRPs were prevalent within the ecology and evolution research community. Across the two groups, we found 64\% of surveyed researchers reported they had at least once failed to report results because they were not statistically significant (cherry picking); 42\% had collected more data after inspecting whether results were statistically significant (a form of p hacking) and 51\% had reported an unexpected finding as though it had been hypothesised from the start (HARKing). Such practices have been directly implicated in the low rates of reproducible results uncovered by recent large scale replication studies in psychology and other disciplines. The rates of QRPs found in this study are comparable with the rates seen in psychology, indicating that the reproducibility problems discovered in psychology are also likely to be present in ecology and evolution.},

Reducing this waste and increasing the value of scientific evidence require changing the actions of both individual researchers and the institutions they depend on for employment and promotion. While ecologists and evolutionary biologists have somewhat improved research transparency over the past decade (e.g. more data sharing), major obstacles remain. In this commentary, we lift our gaze to the horizon to imagine how researchers and institutions can clear the path towards more credible and effective research programmes.},

  abstract = {We characterized headwater stream habitats, fish and amphibian fauna, in and along 106 headwater stream reaches at 12 study sites within managed forest stands 40 to 70 years old in western Oregon. Headwater stream types in our sample included perennial, spatially intermittent, and dry reaches. We captured 454 fish of three species groups and 1,796 amphibians of 12 species. Using canonical correlation, nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination, and generalized linear models, we identified species and assemblages associated with reach hydrologic type (e.g., perennial, intermittent, dry), stream size, gradient, and substrate composition. Our findings of torrent salamander (Rhyacotriton species) occurrences in spatially intermittent streams, and patchy and infrequent occurrences of Cottus fish (sculpins) and coastal tailed frogs (Ascaphus truei Stejneger) suggests these taxa warrant consideration during headwater management for retention of locally distinct biotic resources.},

  abstract = {The usefulness of ecoregions and catchments (hydrologic units) as bases for classifying aquatic vertebrate assemblages in western Oregon was compared using samples collected by electrofishing from 137 wadeable stream sites distributed evenly throughout the region. The classification strengths of these regionalizations were also compared with neutral-model classifications that were based either on intersite proximities in geographic distance or on intersite similarities in the sampled vertebrate assemblages. The strength of each classification was assessed by the extent to which average within-class assemblage similarities exceeded the average similarity between classes. Mean similarity dendrograms were used as a concise graphical comparison of between- and within-class similarities for alternative classifications, whether they were specified a priori or constructed by clustering. For each a priori classification, a permutation test of the no class structure hypothesis was performed. Classification strengths were assessed using the Sorenson--Dice (presence/absence) and Bray--Curtis (relative abundance) similarity measures, applied to both species-level and family-level assemblage characterizations, as well as for the Bray--Curtis measure applied to a set of 5 assemblage metrics that were designed to reflect stream impairment. For all 5 measures of assemblage similarity, ecoregions had higher classification strengths than did large catchments, and large catchments had about the same strength as a stream-order classification. A catchment classification with 1 of the 3 catchments split into 2 ecoregions separated assemblages as strongly as ecoregions alone. A neutral-model classification based solely on geographic site proximity classified assemblages with about the same strength as ecoregions. Another neutral-model classification of sites, based solely on their sampled assemblages, was at least twice as strong as any of the geographic classifications. Intermediate strength was seen in site groupings derived from a composite measure of between-site assemblage and geographic dissimilarities. Our results suggest that ecoregions and large catchments do indeed have utility for classifying stream vertebrate assemblages. However, much of their classification strength may be a result of spatial autocorrelation effects, rather than ecological factors that determine their particular boundaries. Our similarity analyses also suggest that geographic partitions can be expected to account for only a minor portion of the total variation seen in stream vertebrate assemblages across a large region.},
