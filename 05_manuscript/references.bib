  abstract = {Plant-pollinator interactions evolved early in the angiosperm radiation. Ongoing environmental changes are however leading to pollinator declines that may cause pollen limitation to plants and change the evolutionary pressures shaping plant mating systems.We used resurrection ecology methodology to contrast ancestors and contemporary descendants in four natural populations of the field pansy (Viola arvensis) in the Paris region (France), a depauperate pollinator environment. We combine population genetics analysis, phenotypic measurements and behavioural tests on a common garden experiment.Population genetics analysis reveals 27\% increase in realized selfing rates in the field during this period. We documented trait evolution towards smaller and less conspicuous corollas, reduced nectar production and reduced attractiveness to bumblebees, with these trait shifts convergent across the four studied populations.We demonstrate the rapid evolution of a selfing syndrome in the four studied plant populations, associated with a weakening of the interactions with pollinators over the last three decades. This study demonstrates that plant mating systems can evolve rapidly in natural populations in the face of ongoing environmental changes. The rapid evolution towards a selfing syndrome may in turn further accelerate pollinator declines, in an eco-evolutionary feedback loop with broader implications to natural ecosystems.},

  abstract = {By involving the public, citizen science runs against the grain of an idealized science that leaves out the human element, and thus provides new opportunities for ecological research and society. We classify the goals of citizen science in ecology and environment into four broad categories: (1) scientific, (2) participant benefits, (3) community, and (4) policy. Although none of these goals have been well studied, we review the literature showing that these projects are most effective in tracking ecological trends over large swaths of space and time, and discuss the challenges of recruiting, training, retaining, and educating participants, maintaining and disseminating high-quality data, and connecting with the larger community and policy. Biomedical studies, where patients participate in their own treatment in randomized trials, provide an interesting comparison with citizen science in ecology, sharing challenges in recruitment and involvement of nonscientists and ethical conduct of research. Future study will help address the ethical difficulties and enhance ways for citizen science in ecology and the environment to complement scientific discovery, involve and educate the public, and guide policy founded in science and the local community.},

Combining field surveys of 92 populations, 10 common garden experiments throughout the range, species distribution models and greenhouse experiments, we show that mutualistic fungal endophytes ameliorate drought stress and broaden the geographic range of their native grass host Bromus laevipes by thousands of square kilometres ( 20\% larger) into drier habitats. Range differentiation between fungal-associated and fungal-free grasses was comparable to species-level range divergence of congeners, indicating large impacts on range limits. Positive biotic interactions may be underappreciated in determining species' ranges and species' responses to future climates across large geographic scales.},

  abstract = {Population genetic theory predicts that adaptation in novel environments is enhanced by genetic variation for fitness. However, theory also predicts that under strong selection, demographic stochasticity can drive populations to extinction before they can adapt. We exposed wheat-adapted populations of the flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) to a novel suboptimal corn resource, to test the effects of founding genetic variation on population decline and subsequent extinction or adaptation. As previously reported, genetically diverse populations were less likely to go extinct. Here, we show that among surviving populations, genetically diverse groups recovered faster after the initial population decline. Within two years, surviving populations significantly increased their fitness on corn via increased fecundity, increased egg survival, faster larval development, and higher rate of egg cannibalism. However, founding genetic variation only enhanced the increase in fecundity, despite existing genetic variation---and apparent lack of trade-offs---for egg survival and larval development time. Thus, during adaptation to novel habitats the positive impact of genetic variation may be restricted to only a few traits, although change in many life-history traits may be necessary to avoid extinction. Despite severe initial maladaptation and low population size, genetic diversity can thus overcome the predicted high extinction risk in new habitats.},

  abstract = {Species' ranges are limited by both ecological and evolutionary constraints. While there is a growing appreciation that ecological constraints include interactions among species, like competition, we know relatively little about how interactions contribute to evolutionary constraints at species' niche and range limits. Building on concepts from community ecology and evolutionary biology, we review how biotic interactions can influence adaptation at range limits by impeding the demographic conditions that facilitate evolution (which we term a `demographic pathway to adaptation'), and/or by imposing evolutionary trade-offs with the abiotic environment (a `trade-offs pathway'). While theory for the former is well-developed, theory for the trade-offs pathway is not, and empirical evidence is scarce for both. Therefore, we develop a model to illustrate how fitness trade-offs along biotic and abiotic gradients could affect the potential for range expansion and niche evolution following ecological release. The model shows that which genotypes are favoured at species' range edges can depend strongly on the biotic context and the nature of fitness trade-offs. Experiments that characterize trade-offs and properly account for biotic context are needed to predict which species will expand their niche or range in response to environmental change.

In the United States, there was a 34\% increase in the amount of land devoted to urban and built-up uses between 1982 and 1997. This increase came predominantly from the conversion of croplands and forestland, with the largest increases in developed area happening in the southern region of the country. In an analysis of drivers influencing developed land uses in the US, we found results that were consistent with hypothesized relationships, including significant increases in development as a result of increases in population density and personal income. From these results, we projected changes in potential future urbanization and development by 2025 given estimated increases in population and real personal income. The projections suggest continued urban expansion over the next 25 years, with the magnitude of increase varying by region. US developed area is projected to increase by 79\%, raising the proportion of the total land base that is developed from 5.2 to 9.2\%. Because much of the growth is expected in areas relatively stressed with respect to human--environment interactions, such as some coastal counties, implications for landscape and urban planning include potential impacts on sensitive watersheds, riparian areas, wildlife habitat, and water supplies.},

Eastern Hemlock (Tsuga canadensis [L.] Carr.) forests, which are unique habitats in eastern North America, are threatened by an introduced insect, the Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (Adelges tsugae Annand). Previous studies have found declines in the abundance of some forest bird species, including the Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens), with increasing infestation by Hemlock Woolly Adelgids. To identify potential mechanisms behind these declines, we studied abundance, breeding biology, and habitat selection of Acadian Flycatchers in 11 Eastern Hemlock-dominated riparian sites in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, representing a continuum of infestation levels, in 2001--2002 and 2006--2007. Eastern Hemlock supported 90\% of all nests and was used more as a nesting substrate than expected at most sites. We found {$\sim$}70\% fewer breeding pairs at heavily infested sites, though nest survival rates were not affected. The results suggest that Acadian Flycatcher populations in Eastern Hemlock forests may decrease with continued decline of Eastern Hemlocks. Populations in the Appalachian Highlands, where the species' association with Eastern Hemlock is most pronounced, may be at greatest risk.},

To efficiently manage and conserve this species and its genetic diversity, knowledge of the genetic structure is crucial. Based on nine polymorphic microsatellite loci, the genetic diversity, genetic structure and gene flow were investigated at 12 sites representing 5--10\% of the natterjack toad localities presently known in Denmark. The expected heterozygosity (HE) within each locality was generally low (range: 0.18--0.43). Further analyses failed to significantly correlate genetic diversity with population size, degree of isolation and increasing northern latitude, indicating a more complex combination of factors in determining the present genetic profile. Genetic differentiation was high (overall {\texttheta}~=~0.29) and analyses based on a Bayesian clustering method revealed that the dataset constituted 11 genetic clusters, defining nearly all sampling sites as distinct populations. Contemporary gene flow among populations was undetectable in nearly all cases, and the failure to detect a pattern of isolation by distance within major regions supported this apparent lack of a gene flow continuum. Indications of a genetic bottleneck were found in three populations. The analyses suggest that the remaining Bufo calamita populations in Denmark are genetically isolated, and represent independent units in a highly fragmented gene pool. Future conservation management of this species is discussed in light of these results.},

Although the book assumes only a minimal knowledge of SAS, more experienced users will learn new techniques of data input and manipulation. Numerous examples of SAS code and output make this an eminently practical book, ensuring that even the uninitiated become sophisticated users of survival analysis. The main topics presented include censoring, survival curves, Kaplan-Meier estimation, accelerated failure time models, Cox regression models, and discrete-time analysis. Also included are topics not usually covered in survival analysis books, such as time-dependent covariates, competing risks, and repeated events. Survival Analysis Using SAS: A Practical Guide, Second Edition, has been thoroughly updated for SAS 9, and all figures are presented using ODS Graphics. This new edition also documents major enhancements to the STRATA statement in the LIFETEST procedure; includes a section on the PROBPLOT command, which offers graphical methods to evaluate the fit of each parametric regression model; introduces the new BAYES statement for both parametric and Cox models, which allows the user to do a Bayesian analysis using MCMC methods; demonstrates the use of the counting process syntax as an alternative method for handling time-dependent covariates; contains a section on cumulative incidence functions; and describes the use of the new GLIMMIX procedure to estimate random-effects models for discrete-time data.

I find an asymmetry between the intraguild prey and predator in their responses to each other's dispersal. The intraguild predator's dispersal strategy and dispersal behavior have strong effects on the intraguild prey's abundance pattern, but the intraguild prey's dispersal strategy and behavior have little or no effect on the intraguild predator's abundance pattern. This asymmetry arises from the different constraints faced by the two species: the intraguild prey has to acquire resources while avoiding predation, but the intraguild predator only has to acquire resources. It leads to puzzling distribution patterns: when the intraguild prey and predator both move away from areas of high density, they become aggregated to high-density habitats, but when they both move toward areas of high resource productivity, they become segregated to resource-poor and resource-rich habitats. Aggregation is more likely when dispersal is random or less optimal, and segregation is more likely as dispersal becomes more optimal. The crucial implication is that trophic constraints dictate the fitness benefits of using dispersal strategies to sample environmental heterogeneity. A strategy that affords greater benefits to an intraguild predator can lead to a more optimal outcome for both the intraguild predator and prey than a strategy that affords greater benefits to an intraguild prey.},

  abstract = {Dispersal is a crucial component of species' responses to climate warming. Warming-induced changes in species' distributions are the outcome of how temperature affects dispersal at the individual level. Yet, there is little or no theory that considers the temperature dependence of dispersal when investigating the impacts of warming on species' distributions. Here I take a first step towards filling this key gap in our knowledge. I focus on ectotherms, species whose body temperature depends on the environmental temperature, not least because they constitute the majority of biodiversity on the planet. I develop a mathematical model of spatial population dynamics that explicitly incorporates mechanistic descriptions of ectotherm life history trait responses to temperature. A novel feature of this framework is the explicit temperature dependence of all phases of dispersal: emigration, transfer and settlement. I report three key findings. First, dispersal, regardless of whether it is random or temperature-dependent, allows both tropical and temperate ectotherms to track warming-induced changes in their thermal environments and to expand their distributions beyond the lower and upper thermal limits of their respective climate envelopes. In the absence of dispersal mortality, warming does not alter these new distributional limits. Second, an analysis based solely on trait response data predicts that tropical ectotherms should be able to expand their distributions polewards to a greater degree than temperate ectotherms. Analysis of the dynamical model confirms this prediction. Tropical ectotherms have an advantage when moving to cooler climates because they experience lower within-patch and dispersal mortality, and their higher thermal optima and maximal birth rates allow them to take advantage of the warmer parts of the year. Previous theory has shown that tropical ectotherms are more successful in invading and adapting the temperate climates than vice versa. This study provides the key missing piece, by showing how temperature-dependent dispersal could facilitate both invasion and adaptation. Third, dispersal mortality does not affect the poleward expansion of ectotherm distributions. But, it prevents both tropical and temperate ectotherms from maintaining sink populations in localities that are too warm to be viable in the absence of dispersal. Dispersal mortality also affects species' abundance patterns, causing a larger decline in abundance throughout the range when species disperse randomly rather than in response to thermal habitat suitability. In this way, dispersal mortality can facilitate the evolution of dispersal modes that maximize fitness in warmer thermal environments.},

  abstract = {Montane tropical rainforests are critically important areas for global bird diversity, but are projected to be highly vulnerable to contemporary climate change. Upslope shifts of lowland species may partially offset declines in upland species but also result in a process of lowland biotic attrition. This latter process is contingent on the absence of species adapted to novel warm climates, and isolation from pools of potential colonizers. In the Australian Wet Tropics, species distribution modelling has forecast critical declines in suitable environmental area for upland endemic birds, raising the question of the future role of both natural and assisted dispersal in species survival, but information is lacking for important neighbouring rainforest regions. Here we use expanded geographic coverage of data to model the realized distributions of 120 bird species found in north-eastern Australian rainforest, including species from potential source locations in the north and recipient locations in the south. We reaffirm previous conclusions as to the high vulnerability of this fauna to global warming, and extend the list of species whose suitable environmental area is projected to decrease. However, we find that expansion of suitable area for some species currently restricted to northern rainforests has the potential to offset biotic attrition in lowland forest of the Australian Wet Tropics. By examining contrasting dispersal scenarios, we show that responses to climate change in this region may critically depend on dispersal limitation, as climate change shifts the suitable environmental envelopes of many species south into currently unsuitable habitats. For lowland and northern species, future change in vegetation connectivity across contemporary habitat barriers is likely to be an important mediator of climate change impacts. In contrast, upland species are projected to become increasingly isolated and restricted. Their survival is likely to be more dependent on the viability of assisted migration, and the emergence and persistence of suitable environments at recipient locations.},

Here, we show that relatively few allopatric pairs of birds, mammals, or amphibians exhibit trait differences consistent with models of divergent adaptation in each of many ecologically relevant traits. By fitting new evolutionary models to numerous sets of sister-pair trait differences, we find that speciating and recently speciated allopatric taxa seem to overwhelmingly evolve under similar rather than divergent macro--selective pressures. This contradicts the classical view of divergent adaptation as a prominent driver of the early stages of speciation and helps synthesize two historical controversies regarding the ecology and geography of species formation.},

  abstract = {How biological diversity is generated and maintained is a fundamental question in ecology. Ecologists have delineated many mechanisms that can, in principle, favor species coexistence and hence maintain biodiversity. Most such coexistence mechanisms require or imply tradeoffs between different aspects of species performance. However, it remains unknown whether simple functional tradeoffs underlie coexistence mechanisms in diverse natural systems. We show that functional tradeoffs explain species differences in long-term population dynamics that are associated with recovery from low density (and hence coexistence) for a community of winter annual plants in the Sonoran Desert. We develop a new general framework for quantifying the magnitude of coexistence via the storage effect and use this framework to assess the strength of the storage effect in the winter annual community. We then combine a 25-year record of vital rates with morphological and physiological measurements to identify functional differences between species in the growth and reproductive phase of the life cycle that promote storage-effect coexistence. Separation of species along a tradeoff between growth capacity and low-resource tolerance corresponds to differences in demographic responses to environmental variation across years. Growing season precipitation is one critical environmental variable underlying the demographic decoupling of species. These results demonstrate how partially decoupled population dynamics that promote local biodiversity are associated with physiological differences in resource uptake and allocation between species. These results for a relatively simple system demonstrate how long-term community dynamics relate to functional biology, a linkage scientists have long sought for more complex systems.},

  abstract = {Ecology Letters (2011) 14: 677--689 Abstract Although some organisms have moved to higher elevations and latitudes in response to recent climate change, there is little consensus regarding the capacity of different species to track rapid climate change via range shifts. Understanding species' abilities to shift ranges has important implications for assessing extinction risk and predicting future community structure. At an expanding front, colonization rates are determined jointly by rates of reproduction and dispersal. In addition, establishment of viable populations requires that individuals find suitable resources in novel habitats. Thus, species with greater dispersal ability, reproductive rate and ecological generalization should be more likely to expand into new regions under climate change. Here, we assess current evidence for the relationship between leading-edge range shifts and species' traits. We found expected relationships for several datasets, including diet breadth in North American Passeriformes and egg-laying habitat in British Odonata. However, models generally had low explanatory power. Thus, even statistically and biologically meaningful relationships are unlikely to be of predictive utility for conservation and management. Trait-based range shift forecasts face several challenges, including quantifying relevant natural history variation across large numbers of species and coupling these data with extrinsic factors such as habitat fragmentation and availability.},

Notwithstanding the potential of unstructured citizen science to engage the public and collect large amounts of biodiversity data, observers' considerations regarding what, where and when to monitor result in biases in the aggregate database, thus impeding the ability to draw conclusions about trends in species' spatio-temporal distribution. Hence, the goal of this study is to enhance our understanding of observer-based biases in citizen science for biodiversity monitoring. Toward this goals we: (a) develop a conceptual framework of observers' decision-making process along the steps of monitor -- \&gt; record and share, identifying the considerations that take place at each step, specifically highlighting the factors that influence the decisions of whether to record an observation (b) propose an approach for operationalizing the framework using a targeted and focused questionnaire, which gauges observers' preferences and behavior throughout the decision-making steps, and (c) illustrate the questionnaire's ability to capture the factors driving observer-based biases by employing data from a local project on the iNaturalist platform.

Understanding a species' ability to successfully shift its geographical range would allow us to assess extinction risks and predict future community compositions. We investigate how habitat configuration impedes or promotes climate-driven range shifts, given different speeds of climate change and dispersal abilities. Location Theoretical, but illustrated with European examples. Methods We model how a species' ability to track a directional shift in climatic conditions is affected by (a) species' dispersal abilities; (b) speed of climatic shift; and (c) spatial arrangement of the habitat. Our modelling framework includes within-and between-patch population dynamics and uses ecologically realistic habitat distributions and dispersal scenarios (verified with data from a set of European mammal species) and, as such, is an improvement of classical range shift models. Results In landscapes with a homogeneous distribution of suitable habitats, all but the least dispersive species will be able to range shift. However, species with high dispersal ability will have lower population densities after range shift. In heterogeneous landscapes species' ability to range shift is far more variable and heavily dependent on the habitat configuration. This means that landscape configuration in combination with the speed of climate change and species dispersal abilities give rise to nonlinear effects on population sizes and survival after a climatic shift. Main conclusions Our analyses point out the importance of accounting for the interplay of species dispersal and the landscape configuration when estimating future climate impact on species. These results link ecologically important attributes of both species and their landscapes to outcomes of species range shift, and thereby long-term persistence of ecological communities.},

Nevertheless, few studies empirically estimated the impact of roadkill on wildlife populations. We integrated information on roadkill rates, population abundance, and animal movement to estimate the survival rates and the proportion of the population likely to be extirpated due to roadkill, using giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) as model species. We then assessed the consequent implications of roadkill on population persistence using population viability analysis (PVA). The yearly survival rate of resident anteaters inhabiting road vicinity areas (0.78; CI: 0.62-0.97) was considerably lower than for those living far from roads (0.95; CI:0.86--1.00). The real number of anteaters being road-killed is considerably higher than the one recorded in previous studies (by a factor of 2.4), with ca. 20\% of the population inhabiting road vicinity areas being road-killed every year. According to PVA results, roadkill can greatly affect the persistence of the giant anteater populations by reducing the growth rate down to null or negative values. This study confirms that roads have significant impacts on local population persistence. Such impacts are likely to be common to other large mammals, calling for effective mitigation to reduce roadkill rates.},

Generally, as density increased the swimming activity in each behaviour decreased while as temperature increased swimming activity increased. The direction of the effects were the same when total time spent swimming per unit time was examined. Nearest neighbour analysis showed that A. deanei form obvious aggregations in laboratory tanks as density increases, and this effect remains significant at least to the third neighbour. Density had a significant effect on neighbour distances whereas temperature did not. It was hypothesized that the primary function of these aggregations, which are also commonly observed in the field, is an anti-predator behaviour. Laboratory experiments using models of a common sit-and-wait predator of A. deanei, showed that although the encounter rate increased with both water temperature and density the observed encounter rate at the higher densities was significantly less than expected with a random distribution of prey.

Previous studies have demonstrated that dispersal is influenced by body condition; however, few studies have been able to separate the effects of body condition from correlated variables such as body size. Moreover, the results of these studies have been inconsistent with respect to the direction of the relationship between condition and dispersal. We examined whether body condition influences dispersal in backswimmers (Notonecta undulata). We also tested whether an interaction between body condition and predation risk (another proximate factor that influences dispersal) could contribute to the previously observed inconsistent relationship between condition and dispersal. We imposed diet treatments on backswimmers in the laboratory, and measured the effects of food availability on body condition and dispersal in the field. We found that dispersal was a positive function of body condition, which may have important consequences for population characteristics such as the rate of gene flow and population growth. However, the effects of body condition and predation risk were additive, not interactive, and therefore, our data do not support the hypothesis that the interaction between condition and predation risk contributes to the inconsistency in the results of previous condition-dependent dispersal studies.},

We performed a factorial experiment in mesocosms using backswimmers (Notonecta undulata), flight-capable, semi-aquatic insects. Emigration rates increased with density, and increased with predation risk at intermediate densities; however, predation had minimal effects on emigration at high and low densities. Our results indicate that factorial experiments may be required to understand dispersal dynamics under realistic ecological conditions.},

  abstract = {Empirical studies have documented both positive and negative density-dependent dispersal, yet most theoretical models predict positive density dependence as a mechanism to avoid competition. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the occurrence of negative density-dependent dispersal, but few of these have been formally modeled. Here, we developed an individual-based model of the evolution of density-dependent dispersal. This model is novel in that it considers the effects of density on dispersal directly, and indirectly through effects on individual condition. Body condition is determined mechanistically, by having juveniles compete for resources in their natal patch. We found that the evolved dispersal strategy was a steep, increasing function of both density and condition. Interestingly, although populations evolved a positive density-dependent dispersal strategy, the simulated metapopulations exhibited negative density-dependent dispersal. This occurred because of the negative relationship between density and body condition: high density sites produced low-condition individuals that lacked the resources required for dispersal. Our model, therefore, generates the novel hypothesis that observed negative density-dependent dispersal can occur when high density limits the ability of organisms to disperse. We suggest that future studies consider how phenotype is linked to the environment when investigating the evolution of dispersal.},

  abstract = {Dispersal determines the spatial dynamics of host-parasite assemblages, particularly during invasions and disease epidemics. The risk of parasitism may create an incentive for dispersal, but infection is expected to reduce dispersal ability, which may alter the host's dispersal response to biotic stressors, including population density. We measured the dispersal of a semiaquatic insect (Notonecta undulata) in aquatic mesocosms in which we manipulated the presence of ectoparasitic Hydrachnidia mites and infected conspecifics. We found that parasitism risk increases host dispersal propensity. Using a flight assay, we determined that parasite infection reduces host dispersal ability. Finally, we used a mark-release-recapture study to investigate the joint effects of both parasitism risk and parasite infection on host dispersal in a natural, spatially structured population. We found that parasitism risk reduced dispersal probability, eliminated positive density-dependent dispersal, and increased dispersal distance. Infection had no effect on dispersal in the natural population. Our results show that parasites can both increase and decrease the movement rates of their hosts, depending on the ecological context, and can alter the host's dispersal response to other biotic stressors. Future studies should consider the consequences of this double-headed impact of parasites for landscape connectivity, population persistence, and host-parasite coevolution.},

We measured the effects of multiple phenotypic (sex and body size) and environmental (population density and sex ratio) factors, on both dispersal probability and dispersal distance. We found support for the hypothesis that interactive effects influence dispersal and produce variability in phenotype- and environment-dependent dispersal: dispersal probability was dependent on the three-way interaction between sex, body mass and population density. Small males displayed strong, positive density dependence in their dispersal behaviour, while large males and females overall did not respond strongly to density. Small notonectids, regardless of sex, were more likely to disperse, but this effect was strongest at high population densities. Finally, the distance dispersed by backswimmers was a negative function of population density, a pattern which we hypothesize could be related to: (a) individuals from high and low density patches having different dispersal strategies, or (b) the effect of density on dispersal capacity. These results suggest that phenotype-by-environment interactions strongly influence dispersal. Since phenotype- and environment-dependent dispersal has different consequences for ecological and evolutionary dynamics (e.g. metapopulation persistence and local adaptation) than random dispersal, interactive effects may have wide-reaching impacts on populations and communities.

We examined the extent to which understory arthropod biomass, vegetation structure, and breeding productivity affected habitat use by Acadian Flycatchers across 36 mature riparian forests along an urbanization gradient in central Ohio, 2001--2002. Using an information-theoretic approach, we found that although vegetation structure and understory arthropod biomass were associated with nest and territory location at small spatial scales, they failed to explain habitat use across stands. Instead, percentage of urban cover in the landscape best explained variation in the abundance of Acadian Flycatchers among stands. In fact, Acadian Flycatchers were \&gt;3{\texttimes} more abundant in the most rural ({$\leq$}1\% urban) riparian forests than in the more urban ({$\geq$}10\% urban) riparian forests. Nest survival and productivity also declined as urban development increased within the landscape. We suggest that increased nest predation in urban riparian forests, coupled with either reduced productivity or site fidelity or both, may be an underlying mechanism of landscape-scale patterns. Results suggest that explicit consideration of multiple spatial scales, and especially landscape matrix composition, is critical for understanding habitat use.Uso del H{\'a}bitat Dependiente de la Escala por parte de Empidonax virescens en el Centro de Ohio},

Of the nine species more abundant in hemlocks than other forested habitats, only two, the Acadian Flycatcher and Dendroica virens (Black-throated Green Warbler), were positively associated with living hemlocks. Contopus virens (Eastern Wood-pewee), Myiarchus crinitus (Great-crested Flycatcher), and Hylocichla mustelina (Wood Thrush) were negatively associated with the amount of living hemlocks and were apparently benefiting from the increased number of dead trees and canopy gaps associated with the adelgid infestation. Acadian Flycatcher nest sites had more living hemlocks and were less impacted by adelgid than random sites. Nest success did not differ by habitat variables. Initially, hemlock decline will negatively impact hemlock specialists while providing habitat for opportunistic species. Some specialist species might persist by shifting habitats, but long-term studies are needed.}

To date, however, few experimental studies have tested this general hypothesis. One common source of anthropogenic noise is the sound of roadway traffic. We tested the hypothesis that road traffic noise can mask a female's perception of male signals in the grey treefrog, Hyla chrysoscelis, by comparing the effects of traffic noise and the background noise of a breeding chorus on female responses to advertisement calls. In this species, advertisement calls are necessary and sufficient to attract females for breeding. Using a phonotaxis assay, we presented females with an advertisement call broadcast at one of nine signal levels (37--85dB, 6-dB steps) in one of three masking conditions: (1) no masking noise, (2) a noise simulating a moderately dense breeding chorus, or (3) a noise modelled after road traffic noise recorded in two wetlands near major roads. Females showed similar increases in response latency and decreases in orientation towards the target signal in the presence of both the chorus noise and the traffic noise maskers. Moreover, response thresholds were elevated by about 20--25dB in the presence of both noise maskers compared to the unmasked condition. Our results suggest that realistic levels of traffic noise could place constraints on the active space of the acoustic signals of some animals.},

Long-term effects of roads on population dynamics are often severe and mitigation methods include volunteer rescues and under-road tunnels. Despite the development of methods that reduce road kill in specific locations, especially under-road tunnels and culverts, there is scant evidence that such measures will protect populations over the long term.

  abstract = {Parasites, including macroparasites, protists, fungi, bacteria and viruses, can impose a heavy burden upon host animals. However, hosts are not without defences. One aspect of host defence, behavioural avoidance, has been studied in the terrestrial realm for over 50 years, but was first reported from the aquatic environment approximately 20 years ago. Evidence has mounted on the importance of parasite avoidance behaviours and it is increasingly apparent that there are core similarities in the function and benefit of this defence mechanism between terrestrial and aquatic systems. However, there are also stark differences driven by the unique biotic and abiotic characteristics of terrestrial and aquatic (marine and freshwater) environments. Here, we review avoidance behaviours in a comparative framework and highlight the characteristics of each environment that drive differences in the suite of mechanisms and cues that animals use to avoid parasites. We then explore trade-offs, potential negative effects of avoidance behaviour and the influence of human activities on avoidance behaviours. We conclude that avoidance behaviours are understudied in aquatic environments but can have significant implications for disease ecology and epidemiology, especially considering the accelerating emergence and re-emergence of parasites.

  abstract = {Interactions between plants and soil fungi and bacteria are ubiquitous and have large effects on individual plant fitness. However, the degree to which spatial variation in soil microbial communities modulates plant species' distributions remains largely untested. Using the California native plant Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana we paired glasshouse and field reciprocal transplants of plant populations and soils to test whether plant--microbe interactions affect the plant's geographic range limit and whether there is local adaptation between plants and soil microbe communities. In the field and glasshouse, one of the two range interior inocula had a positive effect on plant fitness. In the field, this benefit was especially pronounced at the range edge and beyond, suggesting possible mutualist limitation. In the glasshouse, soil inocula from beyond-range tended to increase plant growth, suggesting microbial enemy release beyond the range margin. Amplicon sequencing revealed stark variation in microbial communities across the range boundary. Plants dispersing beyond their range limit are likely to encounter novel microbial communities. In C. x. xantiana, our results suggest that range expansion may be facilitated by fewer pathogens, but could also be hindered by a lack of mutualists. Both negative and positive plant--microbe interactions will likely affect contemporary range shifts.},

  abstract = {The majority of studies on environmental change focus on the response of single species and neglect fundamental biotic interactions, such as mutualism, competition, predation, and parasitism, which complicate patterns of species persistence. Under global warming, disruption of community interactions can arise when species differ in their sensitivity to rising temperature, leading to mismatched phenologies and/or dispersal patterns. To study species persistence under global climate change, it is critical to consider the ecology and evolution of multispecies interactions; however, the sheer number of potential interactions makes a full study of all interactions unfeasible. One mechanistic approach to solving the problem of complicated community context to global change is to (i) define strategy groups of species based on life-history traits, trophic position, or location in the ecosystem, (ii) identify species involved in key interactions within these groups, and (iii) determine from the interactions of these key species which traits to study in order to understand the response to global warming. We review the importance of multispecies interactions looking at two trait categories: thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate and associated life-history traits and dispersal traits of species. A survey of published literature shows pronounced and consistent differences among trophic groups in thermal sensitivity of life-history traits and in dispersal distances. Our approach increases the feasibility of unraveling such a large and diverse set of community interactions, with the ultimate goal of improving our understanding of community responses to global warming.},

However, when selection pressures are highly variable along a species' range or through time adaptive alleles may persist at intermediate frequencies for long periods. So called ``balanced polymorphisms'' have long been understood to be an important component of standing genetic variation, yet direct evidence of the strength of balancing selection and the stability and prevalence of balanced polymorphisms has remained elusive. We hypothesized that environmental fluctuations among seasons in a North American orchard would impose temporally variable selection on Drosophila melanogaster that would drive repeatable adaptive oscillations at balanced polymorphisms. We identified hundreds of polymorphisms whose frequency oscillates among seasons and argue that these loci are subject to strong, temporally variable selection. We show that these polymorphisms respond to acute and persistent changes in climate and are associated in predictable ways with seasonally variable phenotypes. In addition, our results suggest that adaptively oscillating polymorphisms are likely millions of years old, with some possibly predating the divergence between D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Taken together, our results are consistent with a model of balancing selection wherein rapid temporal fluctuations in climate over generational time promotes adaptive genetic diversity at loci underlying polygenic variation in fitness related phenotypes.},

  abstract = {▪ Abstract Movement between discrete habitat patches can present significant challenges to organisms. Freshwater invertebrates achieve dispersal using a variety of mechanisms that can be broadly categorized as active or passive, and which have important consequences for processes of colonization, gene flow, and evolutionary divergence. Apart from flight in adult freshwater insects, active dispersal appears relatively uncommon. Passive dispersal may occur through transport by animal vectors or wind, often involving a specific desiccation-resistant stage in the life cycle. Dispersal in freshwater taxa is difficult to study directly, and rare but biologically significant dispersal events may remain undetected. Increased use of molecular markers has provided considerable insight into the frequency of dispersal in freshwater invertebrates, particularly for groups such as crustaceans and bryozoans that disperse passively through the transport of desiccation-resistant propagules. The establishment of propagule banks in sediment promotes dispersal in time and may be particularly important for passive dispersers by allowing temporal escape from unfavorable conditions. Patterns that apply to dispersal in freshwater invertebrates can be readily extended to other freshwater taxa, since common challenges arise from the colonization of isolated aquatic systems.},

In fishes, there are potential costs if ectoparasites decrease streamlining, thereby directly compromising swimming performance. Few studies have examined the effects of ectoparasites on fish swimming performance and none distinguish between energetic costs imposed by changes in streamlining and effects on host physiology. The bridled monocle bream (Scolopsis bilineatus) is parasitized by an isopod (Anilocra nemipteri), which attaches above the eye. We show that parasitized fish have higher standard metabolic rates (SMRs), poorer aerobic capacities and lower maximum swimming speeds than non-parasitized fish. Adding a model parasite did not affect SMR, but reduced maximum swimming speed and elevated oxygen consumption rates at high speeds to levels observed in naturally parasitized fish. This demonstrates that ectoparasites create drag effects that are important at high speeds. The higher SMR of naturally parasitized fish does, however, reveal an effect of parasitism on host physiology. This effect was easily reversed: fish whose parasite was removed 24 h earlier did not differ from unparasitized fish in any performance metrics. In sum, the main cost of this ectoparasite is probably its direct effect on streamlining, reducing swimming performance at high speeds.},

However, wild animals face numerous ecological challenges that can compromise their health, reduce their performance capacity, impair their movement abilities and, ultimately, lower their fitness. By diverting resources and increasing host energetic demands, parasites, bacteria, and viruses (hereafter parasites) can dramatically influence the ways in which their hosts allocate energy to movement. Yet, the role of parasites in influencing animal locomotor performance and movement remains relatively unexplored, perhaps because animals often hide outward signs of sickness, and parasites tend to be small and inconspicuous to researchers. Here, we review how parasite infection can alter host locomotor performance via impacts on host morphology and physiology. We also give examples of behavioral strategies that some hosts employ to help overcome the disadvantages imposed by infection. Finally, we discuss how parasites can lead to both increased and decreased host movement patterns, either as an adaptive strategy for the host or due to manipulation by the parasite. The dynamic interplay between host movement (such as migration and dispersal) and infection has profound consequences for population and ecosystem-level processes that are influenced by movement. Acknowledging the important functional role played by parasites in driving the evolution of host locomotor performance and behavior is a critical step toward developing a comprehensive understanding of the causes and consequences of animal movement.},

  abstract = {Despite the fact that the loss of a species from a community has the potential to cause a dramatic decline in biodiversity, for example through cascades of secondary extinctions, little is known about the factors contributing to the extinction risk of any particular species. Here we expand earlier modeling approaches using a dynamic food-web model that accounts for bottom-up as well as top-down effects. We investigate what factors influence a species' extinction risk and time to extinction of the non-persistent species. We identified three basic properties that affect a species' risk of extinction. The highest extinction risk is born by species with (1) low energy input (e.g. high trophic level), (2) susceptibility to the loss of energy pathways (e.g. specialists with few prey species) and (3) dynamic instability (e.g. low Hill exponent and reliance on homogeneous energy channels when feeding on similarly sized prey). Interestingly, and different from field studies, we found that the trophic level and not the body mass of a species influences its extinction risk. On the other hand, body mass is the single most important factor determining the time to extinction of a species, resulting in small species dying first. This suggests that in the field the trophic level might have more influence on the extinction risk than presently recognized.

Yet existing theory remains largely untested at large spatial and temporal scales. We manipulated food available to age-0 rainbow trout while at risk of cannibalism, in a replicated factorial whole-lake experiment, to test whether the trade-off between growth and mortality rates is mediated by foraging activity by young fish under predation risk. We found that this trade-off exists for young fish at the whole-system scale, and that food-dependent behavioral variation has large mortality consequences. In high-food lakes, age-0 trout spent less time moving, fewer individuals swam continuously, and those swimming continuously swam at slower speeds relative to those in low-food lakes. Age-0 trout also used deep, risky habitats less when food was abundant. This lower activity, combined with avoidance of risky habitats, coincided with 68\% higher survival in high-food lakes. If general, this trade-off may be a key mechanism linking individual behavior to population-level processes in size-structured populations.},

  abstract = {Recent studies about mutualism consider the complexity and versatility of the relationship, in addition to highlighting the importance of the cost/benefit balance between the two protagonists. Because species interactions are highly dependent on the environment, the climate changes foreseen for the coming years are expected to have significant impacts on the evolution of mutualistic interactions. Among mutualisms, the aphid--ant interaction is well documented, partly explained by the pest status of aphids. This literature review focuses on the impact of climate change (particularly atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and temperature) on aphid biology and the potential consequences with respect to their mutualistic interactions with ants. We provide an overview of the published reports concerned with the effects of temperature and carbon dioxide on aphids, for which a positive, a negative or no effect has been highlighted. We then discuss how climatic changes can alter four major components of aphid biology that are shaping their interaction with ants: (i) aphid population growth; (ii) aphid behaviour and mobility; (iii) honeydew production and composition; and (iv) semiochemistry. Finaly, we discuss the limitations of such studies on aphid--ant mutualism, as well as the information that is still needed to predict how climate change might impact this type of relationship.},

  abstract = {Abstract. 1 We assessed experimentally the effects of the predatory backswimmer, Notonecta maculata, on naturally colonizing mosquito populations in artificial outdoor pools in the Negev Desert, Israel. A single Notonecta adult per pool (8--15 litres water) had a very large negative impact on populations of Culiseta longiareolata, the most common species found in natural local pools. Notonecta caused large reductions of Culiseta egg rafts and early-instar larvae (instars I and II) and virtually 100\% reductions of late-instar Culiseta larvae (instars III and IV) and pupae. 2 Notonecta also caused a trophic cascade in the experimental pools; by preying on periphyton-feeding Culiseta larvae, Notonecta indirectly caused significantly higher densities of diatoms, the major component of the periphyton. 3 Surveys of nearby natural pools taken between March and May supported the experimental results: a strong negative association between Notonecta and Culiseta among pools occurred as Notonecta increased in numbers and became more widely distributed. Anopheles (occurring only in May) and Culex mosquito immatures were not negatively associated with Notonecta. Culiseta was not associated with surface vegetation whereas both Culex and Anopheles showed strong positive associations with surface vegetation both among and within pools. We attribute the negative association between the predator and Culiseta to local prey extinctions caused by Notonecta in individual pools. Culiseta, being an open water species, is apparently more prone to predation by Notonecta than the vegetation-dwelling Culex and Anopheles.},

When climate changes faster than species can spread, the climate experienced at species' expanding range edges may ameliorate as conditions become increasingly similar to those of the range core. When this boosts species' growth rates, their spread accelerates. Here, we use simulations of a spreading population with an annual life history to explore how climatic amelioration interacts with dispersal evolution and local adaptation to determine the dynamics of spread. We found that depending on the timing of dispersal evolution, spread velocity can show contrasting trajectories, sometimes transiently exceeding the climate velocity before decelerating. Climatic amelioration can also accelerate the spread of populations composed of genotypes best adapted to local climatic conditions, but the exact dynamics depends on the pattern of climatic adaptation. We conclude that failing to account for demographic variation across climatic gradients can lead to erroneous conclusions about species' capacity to spatially track suitable climate.},

To identify possible dynamics of species when including these factors, we ran simulations of two competing species using an individual-based, coupled map--lattice model using a linear climatic gradient that varies across latitude and is warmed over time. Reproductive success is governed by an individual's adaptation to local climate as well as its location relative to global constraints. In exploratory experiments varying the strength of adaptation and competition, competition reduces genetic diversity and slows range change, although the two species can coexist in the absence of climate change and shift in the absence of competitors. We also found that one species can drive the other to extinction, sometimes long after climate change ends. Weak selection on local adaptation and poor dispersal ability also caused surfing of cooler-adapted phenotypes from the expanding margin backwards, causing loss of warmer-adapted phenotypes. Finally, geographic ranges can become disjointed, losing centrally-adapted genotypes. These initial results suggest that the interplay between local adaptation and interspecific competition can significantly influence species' responses to climate change, in a way that demands future research.},

  abstract = {Understanding and predicting the dynamics of range expansion is a major topic in ecology both for invasive species extending their ranges into non-native regions and for species shifting their natural distributions as a consequence of climate change. In an increasingly modified landscape, a key question is `how do populations spread across patchy landscapes?` Dispersal is a central process in range expansion and while there is a considerable theory on how the shape of a dispersal kernel influences the rate of spread, we know much less about the relationships between emigration, movement and settlement rules, and invasion rates. Here, we use a simple, single species individual-based model that explicitly simulates animal dispersal to establish how density-dependent emigration and settlement rules interact with landscape characteristics to determine spread rates. We show that depending on the dispersal behaviour and on the risk of mortality in the matrix, increasing the number of patches does not necessarily maximise the spread rate. This is due to two effects: first, individuals dispersing at the expanding front are likely to exhibit lower net-displacement as they typically do not travel far before finding a patch; secondly, with increasing availability of high quality habitat, density-dependence in emigration and settlement can decrease the number of emigrants and their net-displacement. The rate of spread is ultimately determined by the balance between net travelled distance, the dispersal mortality and the number of dispersing individuals, which in turn depend on the interaction between the landscape and the species' dispersal behaviour. These results highlight that predicting spread rates in heterogeneous landscapes is a complex task and requires better understanding of the rules that individuals use in emigration, transfer and settlement decisions.},

During current range shifts, species are simultaneously confronted with a second major anthropogenic disturbance, landscape fragmentation. Using individual-based models with a shifting climate window, we examine the effect of different rates of climate change on the evolution of dispersal distances through changes in the genetically determined dispersal kernel. Our results demonstrate that the rate of climate change is positively correlated to the evolved dispersal distances although too fast climate change causes the population to crash. When faced with realistic rates of climate change, greater dispersal distances evolve than those required for the population to keep track of the climate, thereby maximizing population size. Importantly, the greater dispersal distances that evolve when climate change is more rapid, induce evolutionary rescue by facilitating the population in crossing large gaps in the landscape. This could ensure population persistence in case of range shifting in fragmented landscapes. Furthermore, we highlight problems in using invasion speed as a proxy for potential range shifting abilities under climate change.},

  abstract = {The accuracy of gene flow estimates is unknown in most natural populations because direct estimates of dispersal are often not possible. These estimates can be highly imprecise or even biased because population genetic structure reflects more than a simple balance between genetic drift and gene flow. Most of the models used to estimate gene flow also assume very simple patterns of movement. As a result, multiple interpretations of population structure involving contemporary gene flow, departures from equilibrium, and other factors are almost always possible. One way to isolate the relative contribution of gene flow to population genetic differentiation is to utilize comparative methods. Population genetic statistics such as FST, heterozygosity and Nei's D can be compared between species with differing dispersal abilities if these species are otherwise phylogenetically, geographically and demographically comparable. Accordingly, the available literature was searched for all groups that meet these criteria to determine whether broad conclusions regarding the relationships between dispersal, population genetic structure, and gene flow estimates are possible. Allozyme and mtDNA data were summarized for 27 animal groups in which dispersal differences can be characterized. In total, genetic data were obtained for 333 species of vertebrates and invertebrates from terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats. Across these groups, dispersal ability was consistently related to population structure, with a mean rank correlation of -0.72 between ranked dispersal ability and FST. Gene flow estimates derived from private alleles were also correlated with dispersal ability, but were less widely available. Direct-count heterozygosity and average values of Nei's D showed moderate degrees of correlation with dispersal ability. Thus, despite regional, taxonomic and methodological differences among the groups of species surveyed, available data demonstrate that dispersal makes a measurable contribution to population genetic differentiation in the majority of animal species in nature, and that gene flow estimates are rarely so overwhelmed by population history, departures from equilibrium, or other microevolutionary forces as to be uninformative.},

In general, costs of transfer have been more widely documented in actively dispersing organisms, in contrast to a greater focus on costs during departure and settlement in plants and animals with a passive transfer phase. Costs related to the development of specific dispersal attributes appear to be much more prominent than previously accepted. Because costs induce trade-offs, they give rise to covariation between dispersal and other life-history traits at different scales of organismal organisation. The consequences of (i) the presence and magnitude of different costs during different phases of the dispersal process, and (ii) their internal organisation through covariation with other life-history traits, are synthesised with respect to potential consequences for species conservation and the need for development of a new generation of spatial simulation models.},

  abstract = {The study of tradeoffs among major life history components (age at maturity, lifespan and reproduction) allowed the development of a quantitative framework to understand how environmental variation shapes patterns of biodiversity among and within species. Because every environment is inherently spatially structured, and in most cases temporally variable, individuals need to move within and among habitats to maximize fitness. Dispersal is often assumed to be tightly integrated into life histories through genetic correlations with other vital traits. This assumption is particularly strong within the context of a fast-slow continuum of life-history variation. Such a framework is to date used to explain many aspects of population and community dynamics. Evidence for a consistent and context-independent integration of dispersal in life histories is, however, weak. We therefore advocate the explicit integration of dispersal into life history theory as a principal axis of variation influencing fitness, that is free to evolve, independently of other life history traits. We synthesize theoretical and empirical evidence on the central role of dispersal and its evolutionary dynamics on the spatial distribution of ecological strategies and its impact on population spread, invasions and coexistence. By applying an optimality framework we show that the inclusion of dispersal as an independent dimension of life histories might substantially change our view on evolutionary trajectories in spatially structured environments. Because changes in the spatial configuration of habitats affect the costs of movement and dispersal, adaptations to reduce these costs will increase phenotypic divergence among and within populations. We outline how this phenotypic heterogeneity is anticipated to further impact population and community dynamics.},

Rather than treating dispersal as a fixed trait, it should be considered a plastic process that responds to both genetic and environmental conditions. Here, we consider how the ambient temperature experienced by juvenile Erigone atra, a spider inhabiting crop habitat, influences adult dispersal. This species exhibits 2 distinct forms of dispersal, ballooning (long distance) and rappelling (short distance). Using a half-sib design we raised individuals under 4 different temperature regimes and quantified the spiders' propensity to balloon and to rappel. Additionally, as an indicator of investment in settlement, we determined the size of the webs build by the spiders following dispersal. The optimal temperature regimes for reproduction and overall dispersal investment were 20 {$^\circ$}C and 25 {$^\circ$}C. Propensity to perform short-distance movements was lowest at 15 {$^\circ$}C, whereas for long-distance dispersal it was lowest at 30 {$^\circ$}C. Plasticity in dispersal was in the direction predicted on the basis of the risks associated with seasonal changes in habitat availability; long-distance ballooning occurred more frequently under cooler, spring-like conditions and short-distance rappelling under warmer, summer-like conditions. Based on these findings, we conclude that thermal conditions during development provide juvenile spiders with information about the environmental conditions they are likely to encounter as adults and that this information influences the spider's dispersal strategy. Climate change may result in suboptimal adult dispersal behavior, with potentially deleterious population level consequences.},

In insects, cannibalism frequently occurs across life stages, with cannibals consuming a smaller or more vulnerable stage. Predation of adult insects on one another is considered to be uncommon. We investigated adult cannibalism in the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), which is an oligophagous herbivore specializing on plants in family Solanaceae, and an important agricultural pest. Under laboratory conditions, starvation and crowding encouraged teneral adults to feed upon each other, which reduced their weight loss during the period of starvation. However, pupae were attacked and consumed before adults. Injured beetles had a higher probability of being cannibalized than intact beetles. Males were more frequently attacked than females, but that appeared to be a function of their smaller size rather than other gender-specific traits. Cannibalizing eggs at a larval stage did not affect beetle propensity to cannibalize adults at an adult stage. When given a choice between conspecific adults and mealworms, the beetles preferred to eat conspecifics. Cannibalistic behavior, including adult cannibalism, could be important for population persistence in this species.},

Indirect effects may result from parasites altering host metabolic rate and hence host energy needs, yet no experimental studies have shown this to be the case for non-laboratory hosts. We report the results of a long-term field experiment designed to test the impact of parasites on host energetics. We measured the energetics of feral rock doves ( with populations of feather-feeding lice, traditionally considered to have little or no effect on host fitness. The lice reduced feather mass leading to increased thermal conductance and metabolic rate, as well as a steady reduction in host body mass over the course of the nine-month study. Our results demonstrate that even classically `benign' parasites such as feather lice can reduce host condition through the accumulation of subtle energetic costs over time. We argue that experimental manipulations are a prerequisite for documenting such effects.},

Although theory predicts that both will strongly alter the distribution of biomass in whole communities, empirical evidence has not been consolidated to quantitatively determine whether these theoretical predictions are generally borne out in real ecosystems. Here we analyze data from two types of trophic cascade studies, predator removals in factorial combination with fertilization and observed productivity gradients, to assess the role of top-down and bottom-up forces in structuring multi-trophic communities and compare results from these analyses to those from an extensive database of trophic cascade studies. We find that herbivore biomass declines and plant biomass increases in the presence of predators, regardless of system productivity. In contrast, while plants are increased by fertilization, this effect does not significantly increase herbivores in either the presence or absence of predators. These patterns are consistent among marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems and are largely independent of study size and duration. Thus, top-down effects of predation are transferred through more trophic levels than are bottom-up effects of eutrophication, showing strong asymmetry in the direction of control of biomass distribution in communities.},

  abstract = {Many species of insects show phenotypically plastic dispersal traits in response to suboptimal environmental conditions. These polyphenetic traits can have large impacts on the population dynamics of the dispersing insects. Therefore, it is important to understand what environmental factors affect the development of dispersal traits and how these factors affect population dynamics via immigration/emigration. Pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) exhibit a polyphenetic wing dimorphism in which individuals are either winged (alate) or not (apterous). The production of alate offspring is determined by environmental cues experienced by the mother. Environmental factors associated with these cues have been intensively studied, with crowding, host plant quality, natural enemies, fungal infection, and viral infection being shown to affect the production of pea aphid alates under controlled laboratory conditions. Nonetheless, environmental factors affecting alate production have rarely been studied in field populations of pea aphids. Using data from a three-year study of alate production in 5--9 alfalfa (lucerne) fields, we examined the effects of (i) pea aphid abundance, (ii) host plant maturity, (iii) temperature, (iv) predator and herbivore abundance, (v) parasitism, and (vi) entomopathic fungal incidence. In twice-weekly samples taken over the growing season, alate production ranged from 0\% to 83\% of the nymphal population. Pea aphid abundance, temperature, and alfalfa maturity together explained 67\% of the variation in alate production. The other factors we investigated explained little variation. These results suggest there is a limited number of key environmental factors that consistently predict changes in alate production in field populations, while many factors identified in lab studies may be unimportant. Our results highlight the value of investigating factors affecting the expression of plastic traits in insect species at a broad spatiotemporal scale and under natural conditions.},

  abstract = {Classical metapopulation models do not account for temporal changes in the suitability of habitat patches. In reality, however, the carrying capacity of most habitat types is not constant in time due to natural succession processes. In this study, we modeled plant metapopulation persistence in a successional landscape with disappearing and emerging habitat patches, based on a realistic dune slack landscape at the Belgian--French coast. We focused on the effects of the variation of different plant traits on metapopulation persistence in this changing landscape. Therefore, we used a stage based stochastic metapopulation model implemented in RAMAS/Metapop, simulating a large variation in plant traits but keeping landscape characteristics such as patch turnover rate and patch lifespan constant. The results confirm the conclusions of earlier modeling work that seed dispersal distance and seed emigration rate both have an important effect on metapopulation persistence. We also found that high population growth rate or high recruitment considerably decreased the extinction risk of the metapopulation. Additionally, a long plant life span had a strong positive effect on metapopulation persistence, irrespective of the plant's dispersal capacity and population growth rate. Plant species that invest in life span require less investment in offspring and dispersal capacity to avoid extinction, even in dynamic landscapes with deterministic changes in habitat quality. Moreover, metapopulations of long-lived plant species were found to be much less sensitive to high levels of environmental stochasticity than short-lived species.},

However, the adaptability of spatially structured populations may also be affected by dispersal: positively by spreading beneficial mutations across sub-populations, but negatively by moving locally adapted alleles between demes. We develop an individual-based, two-patch, allelic model to investigate the balance between these opposing effects on a population's evolutionary response to rapid climate change. Individual fitness is controlled by two polygenic traits coding for local adaptation either to the environment or to climate. Under conditions of selection that favour the evolution of a generalist phenotype (i.e. weak divergent selection between patches) dispersal has an overall positive effect on the persistence of the population. However, when selection favours locally adapted specialists, the beneficial effects of dispersal outweigh the associated increase in maladaptation for a narrow range of parameter space only (intermediate selection strength and low linkage among loci), where the spread of beneficial climate alleles is not strongly hampered by selection against non-specialists. Given that local selection across heterogeneous and fragmented landscapes is common, the complex effect of dispersal that we describe will play an important role in determining the evolutionary dynamics of many species under rapidly changing climate.},

Large area requirements could result from advantages for certain species when settling their territories near those of conspecifics. This phenomenon would result in spatial aggregations much larger than single territories. Species that aggregate their territories could show reduced population viability in highly fragmented forests, since remnant patches may remain unoccupied if they are too small to accommodate several territories. The objectives of this study were twofold: (1) to seek evidence of territory clusters of forest birds at various spatial scales, lags of 250-550 m, before and after controlling for habitat spatial patterns; and (2) to measure the relationship between spatial autocorrelation and apparent landscape sensitivity for these species. In analyses that ignored spatial variation of vegetation within remnant forest patches, nine of the 17 species studied significantly aggregated their territories within patches. After controlling for forest vegetation, the locations of eight out of 17 species remained significantly clustered. The aggregative pattern that we observed may, thus, be indicative of a widespread phenomenon in songbird populations. Furthermore, there was a tendency for species associated with higher forest cover to be more spatially aggregated (ERRATUM).},

Monarchs inhabiting seasonally fluctuating environments migrate annually, and parasite prevalence is lower among migratory relative to non-migratory populations. One explanation for this pattern is that long-distance migration weeds out infected animals, thus reducing parasite prevalence and transmission between generations. In this study we experimentally infected monarchs from a migratory population and recorded their long-distance flight performance using a tethered flight mill. Results showed that parasitized butterflies exhibited shorter flight distances, slower flight speeds, and lost proportionately more body mass per km flown. Differences between parasitized and unparasitized monarchs were generally not explained by individual variation in wing size, shape, or wing loading, suggesting that poorer flight performance among parasitized hosts was not directly caused by morphological constraints. Effects of parasite infection on powered flight support a role for long-distance migration in dramatically reducing parasite prevalence in this and other host--pathogen systems.},

Changes in infection status can shift the cost-benefit ratio of remaining in a given habitat vs dispersing. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the propensity to disperse in Drosophila nigrospiracula is mediated by current parasite load and the risk of further infection by an ectoparasitic mite (Macrocheles subbadius). An activity monitor was used to assess dispersal propensity among infected and uninfected flies.

In this theme issue, we highlight a novel pathway through which warming indirectly affects ecological communities: by changing their size structure (i.e. the body-size distributions). Warming can shift these distributions towards dominance of small- over large-bodied species. The conceptual, theoretical and empirical research described in this issue, in sum, suggests that effects of temperature may be dominated by changes in size structure, with relatively weak direct effects. For example, temperature effects via size structure have implications for top-down and bottom-up control in ecosystems and may ultimately yield novel communities. Moreover, scaling up effects of temperature and body size from physiology to the levels of populations, communities and ecosystems may provide a crucially important mechanistic approach for forecasting future consequences of global warming.},

Lungworms (Rhabdias pseudosphaerocephala) of cane toads (Rhinella marina) were introduced to Australia from the toad's native range, along with the toads, and have been suggested as a potential biocontrol of invasive toads due to various negative impacts on toad viability. We conducted two radio-telemetry studies on a tropical floodplain to specifically assess the parasite's impact on toad dispersal. First, a retrospective correlative analysis of data from field-collected animals showed that toads infected with lungworms moved farther, not less, than uninfected conspecifics. Second, an experimental study (comparing movements of experimentally infected toads vs. uninfected controls) showed that lungworms did not modify rates of toad dispersal. In addition, experimental infection with lungworms did not elicit an immune response substantial enough to influence dispersal behaviour. Thus, we conclude that increasing lungworm densities at the invasion front as an attempt at biocontrol would not slow down the spread of cane toads.},

Cannibalism is thus influential in the structure and functioning of biological communities. Parasites are also pervasive in nature and, we hypothesize, might affect cannibalism since infection can alter host foraging behaviour. We investigated the effects of a common parasite, the microsporidian Pleistophora mulleri, on the cannibalism rate of its host, the freshwater amphipod Gammarus duebeni celticus. Parasitic infection increased the rate of cannibalism by adults towards uninfected juvenile conspecifics, as measured by adult functional responses, that is, the rate of resource uptake as a function of resource density. This may reflect the increased metabolic requirements of the host as driven by the parasite. Furthermore, when presented with a choice, uninfected adults preferred to cannibalize uninfected rather than infected juvenile conspecifics, probably reflecting selection pressure to avoid the risk of parasite acquisition. By contrast, infected adults were indiscriminate with respect to infection status of their victims, probably owing to metabolic costs of infection and the lack of risk as the cannibals were already infected. Thus parasitism, by enhancing cannibalism rates, may have previously unrecognized effects on stage structure and population dynamics for cannibalistic species and may also act as a selective pressure leading to changes in resource use.},

However, many environmental changes, especially those involving weather (as opposed to climate), are often stochastic, variable and extreme, particularly in temperate terrestrial or freshwater habitats. Moreover, few studies of animal and plant phenotypic plasticity employ realistic (i.e. short-term, stochastic) environmental change in their protocols. Here, I posit that the frequently abrupt environmental changes (days, weeks, months) accompanying much longer-term general climate change (e.g. global warming over decades or centuries) require consideration of the true nature of environmental change (as opposed to statistical means) coupled with an expansion of focus to consider developmental phenotypic plasticity. Such plasticity can be in multiple forms -- obligatory/facultative, beneficial/deleterious -- depending upon the degree and rate of environmental variability at specific points in organismal development. Essentially, adult phenotypic plasticity, as important as it is, will be irrelevant if developing offspring lack sufficient plasticity to create modified phenotypes necessary for survival.},

  abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems appear to be sensitive to even minor climatic shifts, and the dendritic nature of rivers as well as patchy distribution of habitats within the terrestrial landscape could limit the ability of species to track suitable climate conditions. Although the importance of dispersal is recognised in theory, there is great uncertainty when quantifying the capacity of species to shift their distributions in response to climate change. The influence of dispersal capacity on species' vulnerability to climate change was assessed, using the modelled projections of 527 freshwater species in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Species' future ranges were calculated by iteratively identifying colonisation of accessible habitats and loss of suitable habitats within network models. The accessibility of new habitats was based on a given dispersal mode (aquatic, semi-terrestrial and aerial). The relative impact of dispersal parameters on projected range were evaluated alongside other known sources of uncertainty (climate and emissions scenarios, modelling algorithm and biological group), analysed collectively in a generalised additive mixed-model, and spatially to locate regions of NSW where projections are associated with the most uncertainty. Our simulations (1.4 million scenario combinations) suggest at least a third of species will lose more than half their range under climate change. Nevertheless, we emphasise the broad uncertainty that any average encapsulates. Dispersal capacity only had a minor impact on projected range shifts relative to other modelling assumptions but the network-pathways and maps of uncertainty have value for conservation planning at large scales. Projected range losses initially decreased rapidly as dispersal rates increased but the benefits are reduced above 2--3 km year-1. Taxa restricted to dispersal within the stream network (aquatic) were more vulnerable to climate change than taxa with semi-terrestrial or aerial dispersal and maps of variation due to dispersal mode and rate indicate where habitat connectivity would be most beneficial. This study demonstrates the breadth of uncertainties that challenge plans for improving ecosystem adaptation under climate change and highlights where in the landscape those differences were consistent. We emphasise the need for freshwater conservation studies to be ecologically representative, to focus on broad-scale connectivity for taxa that can move between catchments, and an accessible network of refugia for taxa with more limited dispersal.},

Since parasite fitness is often tied to host quality, host preference by parasites is likely to be under strong selection. We test the hypothesis that host preference is sufficient to generate variability in infection rate among conspecifics. Specifically, we ask whether the mite Macrocheles muscaedomesticae is able to discriminate between Drosophila hydei hosts of different sex and size, while explicitly accounting for the potential confounding effects of these two factors. Our results indicate a preference for female hosts, but this preference appears to be driven by size and not sex per se. When differences in body size were controlled for, the sex-biased infection disappeared, while mites presented with the choice of two female flies of disparate sizes were more likely to select the larger host. Across the distribution of fly body weight in this study, mites preferentially attached to flies of intermediate size. This study provides evidence that mite choice for certain host types can play an important role in parasite transmission, even in the absence of differential susceptibility or exposure among hosts.},

Moreover, network theory suggests that structural properties, such as the presence of highly generalist species, are linked to the stability of mutualistic communities. However, we still lack empirical validation of network model predictions. Here we outline new research avenues to connect network models to FSD processes, and illustrate the challenges and opportunities of this tool with a field study. We hypothesized that generalist frugivores would be important for forest stability by dispersing seeds into deforested areas and initiating reforestation. We then constructed a network of plant--frugivore interactions using published data and identified the most generalist frugivores. To test the importance of generalists we measured: 1) the frequency with which frugivores moved between pasture and forest, 2) the bird-generated seed rain under perches in the pasture, and 3) the perching frequency of birds above seed traps. The generalist frugivores in the forest network were not important for seed dispersal into pastures, and thus for forest recovery, because the forest network excluded habitat heterogeneities, frugivore behavior, and movements. More research is~needed to develop ways to incorporate relevant FSD processes into network models in order for these models to be more useful to community ecology and conservation. The network framework can serve to spark and renew interest in FSD and further our understanding of plant--animal communities.},

We compiled the most comprehensive spatially explicit data set available for parasites, projected range shifts in a changing climate, and estimated extinction rates for eight major parasite clades. On the basis of 53,133 occurrences capturing the geographic ranges of 457 parasite species, conservative model projections suggest that 5 to 10\% of these species are committed to extinction by 2070 from climate-driven habitat loss alone. We find no evidence that parasites with zoonotic potential have a significantly higher potential to gain range in a changing climate, but we do find that ectoparasites (especially ticks) fare disproportionately worse than endoparasites. Accounting for host-driven coextinctions, models predict that up to 30\% of parasitic worms are committed to extinction, driven by a combination of direct and indirect pressures. Despite high local extinction rates, parasite richness could still increase by an order of magnitude in some places, because species successfully tracking climate change invade temperate ecosystems and replace native species with unpredictable ecological consequences.},

We present evidence that dead dogwoods tend to have larger neighboring conspecifics than do living dogwoods, that smaller trees have higher levels of foliar infection than larger trees and that in trees of reproductive size, higher levels of anthracnose infection are associated with lower fruit production. In contrast to our data on mortality, proximity to conspecifics did not account for significant variation in the severity of foliar anthracnose infection among live dogwoods.

Highly vagile organisms may be at a disadvantage in landscapes with roads because they are more likely to encounter roads and incur traffic mortality. To test this prediction, we assessed the population abundance of two anuran species of differing vagility, the leopard frog ( Rana pipiens, more vagile) and the green frog ( Rana clamitans, less vagile), at 30 breeding ponds. Traffic density, an index of the amount of potential traffic mortality, was measured in concentric circles radiating from the ponds out to 5 km. We conducted multiple linear regressions relating population abundance to traffic density, pond variables, and landscape habitat variables and found that leopard frog population density was negatively affected by traffic density within a radius of 1.5 km. There was no evidence that the presence of vehicular traffic affected green frog populations. These results suggest that traffic mortality can cause population declines and that more vagile species may be more vulnerable to road mortality than less vagile species.},

These empirical estimates of larval dispersal are key to assessing the significance of metapopulation connectivity within a demographic context, but the life-history data required to do this are rarely available. To evaluate the demographic consequences of connectivity we constructed seasonal, size-structured metapopulation matrix models for two species of mytilid mussel in San Diego County, California, USA. The self-recruitment and larval exchange terms were produced from a time series of realized connectivities derived from trace-elemental fingerprinting of larval shells during spring and fall from 2003 to 2008. Both species exhibited a strong seasonal pattern of southward movement of recruits in spring and northward movement in fall. Growth and mortality terms were estimated using mark--recapture data from representative sites for each species and subpopulation, and literature estimates of juvenile mortality. Fecundity terms were estimated using county-wide settlement data from 2006--2008; these data reveal peak reproduction and recruitment in fall for Mytilus californianus, and spring for M. galloprovincialis. Elasticity and life-stage simulation analyses were employed to identify the season- and subpopulation-specific vital rates and connectivity terms to which the metapopulation growth rate ({$\lambda$}) was most sensitive. For both species, metapopulation growth was most sensitive to proportional changes in adult fecundity, survival and growth of juvenile stages, and population connectivity, in order of importance, but relatively insensitive to adult growth or survival. The metapopulation concept was deemed appropriate for both Mytilus species as exchange between the subpopulations was necessary for subpopulation persistence. However, highest metapopulation growth occurred in years when a greater proportion of recruits was retained within the predominant source subpopulation. Despite differences in habitat and planktonic duration, both species exhibited similar overall metapopulation dynamics with respect to key life stages and processes. However, different peak reproductive periods in an environment of seasonal current reversals led to different regional (subpopulation) contributions to metapopulation maintenance; this result emphasizes the importance of connectivity analysis for spatial management of coastal resources.},

  abstract = {Modeling the potential spread of Xylella fastidiosa can document contingency plans in northern Europe, so far uncolonized by the bacterium. Through mark--release--recapture (MRR) and flight-mill experiments, the flight capacity of two potential vectors for temperate Europe was studied: Philaenus spumarius, the reported southern European vector, and Aphrophora salicina, a xylem-specialist feeding on potential host plants of X. fastidiosa. Aphrophora salicina displayed significantly better flight performances than P. spumarius. In flight-mills, the average distance flown was, respectively, 623~m vs. 102~m and the maximal distance flown was 6.16~km vs. 1.54~km in 2.5~h. In MRRs, A. salicina travelled more than 30~m in a single flight, with a maximal interception distance of 80~m after two days, highlighting that dispersal is driven by connectivity and host plant quality. Philaenus spumarius mainly jumped, with 1~m movements in length and a maximal interception distance of 32~m in 27~days. Models estimated P. spumarius' daily mean dispersal at 1.5~m and A. salicina's at 3.5~m. Although only a small part of the population moves over very long distances, this pool of efficient insects could already be sufficient to effectively spread an epidemic. As Salicaceae have been reported as host plants of the bacterium, the association of Aphrophoridae and Salicaceae in riparian areas could create bacterium reservoirs in corridors allowing for transportation over medium to long distances.},

  abstract = {Darwin viewed species range limits as chiefly determined by an interplay between the abiotic environment and interspecific interactions. Haldane argued that species' ranges could be set intraspecifically when gene flow from a species' populous center overwhelms local adaptation at the periphery. Recently, Kirkpatrick and Barton have modeled Haldane's process with a quantitative genetic model that combines density-dependent local population growth with dispersal and gene flow across a linear environmental gradient in optimum phenotype. To address Darwin's ideas, we have extended the Kirkpatrick and Barton model to include interspecific competition and the frequency-dependent selection that it generates, as well as stabilizing selection on a quantitative character. Our model includes local population growth, movements over space, natural selection, and gene flow. It simultaneously addresses the evolution of character displacement and species borders. It reproduces the Kirkpatrick and Barton single-species result that limited ranges can be produced with sufficiently steep environmental gradients and strong dispersal. Further, in the absence of environmental gradients or barriers to dispersal, interspecific competition will not limit species ranges at evolutionary equilibrium. However, interspecific competition can interact with environmental gradients and gene flow to generate limited ranges with much less extreme gradient and dispersal parameters than in the single-species case. Species display character displacement in sympatry, yet the reduction in competition that results from this displacement does not necessarily allow the two species to become sympatric everywhere. When species meet, competition reduces population densities in the region of overlap, which, in turn, intensifies the asymmetry in gene flow from center to margin. This reduces the ability of each species to adapt to local physical conditions at their range limits. If environmental gradients are monotonic but not linear, the transition zone between species at coevolutionary equilibrium occurs where the environmental gradient is steepest. If productivity gradients are also introduced into the model, then patterns similar to Rapoport's rule emerge. Interacting species respond to climate change, as it affects the optimal phenotype over space, by a combination of range shifts and local evolution in mean phenotype, while solitary species respond solely by range shifts. Finally, we compare empirical estimates for intrinsic growth rates and diffusion coefficients for several species to those needed by the single-species model to produce a stable limited range. These empirical values are generally insufficient to produce limited ranges in the model suggesting a role for interspecific interactions.},

  abstract = {There is growing evidence that anthropogenic landscapes can strongly influence the evolution of dispersal, particularly through fragmentation, and may drive organisms into an evolutionary trap by suppressing dispersal. However, the influence on dispersal evolution of anthropogenic variation in habitat patch turnover has so far been largely overlooked. In this study, we examined how human-driven variation in patch persistence affects dispersal rates and distances, determines dispersal-related phenotypic specialization, and drives neutral genetic structure in spatially structured populations. We addressed this issue in an amphibian, Bombina variegata, using an integrative approach combining capture--recapture modeling, demographic simulation, common garden experiments, and population genetics. B. variegata reproduces in small ponds that occur either in habitat patches that are persistent (i.e., several decades or more), located in riverine environments with negligible human activity, or in patches that are highly temporary (i.e., a few years), created by logging operations in intensively harvested woodland. Our capture--recapture models revealed that natal and breeding dispersal rates and distances were drastically higher in spatially structured populations (SSPs) in logging environments than in riverine SSPs. Population simulations additionally showed that dispersal costs and benefits drive the fate of logging SSPs, which cannot persist without dispersal. The common garden experiments revealed that toadlets reared in laboratory conditions have morphological and behavioral specialization that depends on their habitat of origin. Toadlets from logging SSPs were found to have higher boldness and exploration propensity than those from riverine SSPs, indicating transgenerationally transmitted dispersal syndromes. We also found contrasting patterns of neutral genetic diversity and gene flow in riverine and logging SSPs, with genetic diversity and effective population size considerably higher in logging than in riverine SSPs. In parallel, intrapatch inbreeding and relatedness levels were lower in logging SSPs. Controlling for the effect of genetic drift and landscape connectivity, gene flow was found to be higher in logging than in riverine SSPs. Taken together, these results indicate that anthropogenic variation in habitat patch turnover may have an effect at least as important as landscape fragmentation on dispersal evolution and the long-term viability and genetic structure of wild populations.},

  abstract = {The oft-repeated claim that Earth's biota is entering a sixth ``mass extinction'' depends on clearly demonstrating that current extinction rates are far above the ``background'' rates prevailing between the five previous mass extinctions. Earlier estimates of extinction rates have been criticized for using assumptions that might overestimate the severity of the extinction crisis. We assess, using extremely conservative assumptions, whether human activities are causing a mass extinction. First, we use a recent estimate of a background rate of 2 mammal extinctions per 10,000 species per 100 years (that is, 2 E/MSY), which is twice as high as widely used previous estimates. We then compare this rate with the current rate of mammal and vertebrate extinctions. The latter is conservatively low because listing a species as extinct requires meeting stringent criteria. Even under our assumptions, which would tend to minimize evidence of an incipient mass extinction, the average rate of vertebrate species loss over the last century is up to 100 times higher than the background rate. Under the 2 E/MSY background rate, the number of species that have gone extinct in the last century would have taken, depending on the vertebrate taxon, between 800 and 10,000 years to disappear. These estimates reveal an exceptionally rapid loss of biodiversity over the last few centuries, indicating that a sixth mass extinction is already under way. Averting a dramatic decay of biodiversity and the subsequent loss of ecosystem services is still possible through intensified conservation efforts, but that window of opportunity is rapidly closing.},

In this simulation study, we focus on the concurrent evolution of three traits in response to climate change, namely dispersal probability, temperature tolerance (or niche width), and temperature preference (optimal habitat). More specifically, we consider evolutionary responses in host species involved in different types of interaction, that is parasitism or commensalism, and for low or high costs of a temperature tolerance--fertility trade-off (cost of generalization). We find that host species potentially evolve all three traits simultaneously in response to increasing temperature but that the evolutionary response interacts and may be compensatory depending on the conditions. The evolutionary adjustment of temperature preference is slower in the parasitism than in commensalism scenario. Parasitism, in turn, selects for higher temperature tolerance and increased dispersal. High costs for temperature tolerance (i.e. generalization) restrict evolution of tolerance and thus lead to a faster response in temperature preference than that observed under low costs. These results emphasize the possible role of biotic interactions and the importance of `multidimensional' evolutionary responses to climate change.},

Interaction outcomes are context-dependent when the sign and/or magnitude change as a function of the biotic or abiotic context. While context dependency appears to be common, its distribution in nature is poorly described. Here, we used meta-analysis to quantify variation in species interaction outcomes (competition, mutualism, or predation) for 247 published articles. Contrary to our expectations, variation in the magnitude of effect sizes did not differ among species interactions, and while mutualism was most likely to change sign across contexts (and predation least likely), mutualism did not strongly differ from competition. Both the magnitude and sign of species interactions varied the most along spatial and abiotic gradients, and least as a function of the presence/absence of a third species. However, the degree of context dependency across these context types was not consistent among mutualism, competition and predation studies. Surprisingly, study location and ecosystem type varied in the degree of context dependency, with laboratory studies showing the highest variation in outcomes. We urge that studying context dependency per se, rather than focusing only on mean outcomes, can provide a general method for describing patterns of variation in nature.},

  abstract = {Reconnecting forest patches, including those of floodplain forest, often involves the creation of long, narrow corridors that have the potential to act as ecological traps for wildlife. We examined the effect of forest width and habitat composition of the landscapes immediately around nest patches on survival and parasitism of 359 Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) nests in the Cache River Bioreserve in southern Illinois. Nests were distributed among 19 floodplain forest corridors along a small river system that is being restored and reconnected along its original floodplain. The corridors spanned a range of widths (80--3,170 m) and varied with the presence or absence of natural water-related habitats (beaver ponds, backwater swamps, and creeks). Although nest success varied slightly between stages of the breeding cycle, confidence intervals overlapped, which suggests constant nest success throughout the breeding cycle. Nest survival was relatively high by regional standards but did not vary significantly with any of the landscape variables measured. Contrary to predictions, probabilities of brood parasitism decreased with increasing proportions of anthropogenic habitats surrounding nests. Probabilities of brood parasitism also decreased, but only slightly, as the breeding season progressed. Finally, Acadian Flycatcher nests were located significantly more often near natural (forest-water interface) edges than expected at random. Narrow corridors such as those along floodplain restoration projects do not necessarily create ecological traps for all forest species. Acadian Flycathcers, however, are one of the only forest-nesting Neotropical migrants that nest in narrow corridors and, therefore, may be less vulnerable to negative effects of fragmentation.{\'E}xito de Nidificaci{\'o}n de Empidonax virescens en Corredores de Bosque de Planicies Inundables},

  abstract = {Although habitat loss is the predominant factor leading to biodiversity loss in the Anthropocene1,2, exactly how this loss manifests---and at which scales---remains a central debate3--6. The `passive sampling' hypothesis suggests that species are lost in proportion to their abundance and distribution in the natural habitat7,8, whereas the `ecosystem decay' hypothesis suggests that ecological processes change in smaller and more-isolated habitats such that more species are lost than would have been expected simply through loss of habitat alone9,10. Generalizable tests of these hypotheses have been limited by heterogeneous sampling designs and a narrow focus on estimates of species richness that are strongly dependent on scale. Here we analyse 123~studies of assemblage-level abundances of focal taxa taken from multiple habitat fragments of varying size to evaluate the influence of passive sampling and ecosystem decay on biodiversity loss. We found overall support for the ecosystem decay hypothesis. Across all studies, ecosystems and taxa, biodiversity estimates from smaller habitat fragments---when controlled for sampling effort---contain fewer individuals, fewer species and less-even communities than expected from a sample of larger fragments. However, the diversity loss due to ecosystem decay in some studies (for example, those in which habitat loss took place more than 100~years ago) was less than expected from the overall pattern, as a result of compositional turnover by species that were not originally present in the intact habitats. We conclude that the incorporation of non-passive effects of habitat loss on biodiversity change will improve biodiversity scenarios under future land use, and planning for habitat protection and restoration.},

Mean molt interval and molting percentage are the main factors determining the production rate of a culture facility. Effects of temperature on mean molt interval and molting percentage of red swamp crawfish (Procambarus clarkii) were investigated in laboratory-scale recirculating culture system in two seasons. In this study, higher temperatures resulted in shorter molt intervals. Corresponding to temperatures ranging from 15 to 30 {$^\circ$}C, with a 3 {$^\circ$}C increment, the molt interval decreased non-linearly from 71.2 to 22.6 days. However, lower temperatures seemed to mitigate crawfish mortality and resulted in higher molt percentages. Additionally, the major portion of the mortality occurred within the first 2 weeks of the tests. The results of this study provide a quantitative basis for recommending proper temperatures for a soft-shell crawfish operation. From the production perspective, the ideal temperature lies at the high end of the test temperature range.},

Subclones of pea aphids and blue alfalfa aphids, derived from parent aphid clones that did not contain PASS or PAR, were infected with one or both bacteria, generating PASS- and/or PAR-positive subclones with minimal genetic differences from the parent clones. Under laboratory conditions at 20 {$^\circ$}C, PAR consistently reduced the fecundity (by between 19 and 60\%) of subclones derived from three different parent pea aphid clones on bur clover, Medicago hispida Gaertn. PAR had intermediate effects on pea aphids reared on sweet pea, Lathyrus odoratus L., and had no significant effect on pea aphids on alfalfa, Medicago sativa L. The effect of PASS was either neutral or negative, depending on parent clone as well as host plant. Also at 20 {$^\circ$}C, PASS reduced fecundity (70--77\%) and longevity (40--48\%), and increased the age of first reproduction (by up to 1.5 days) of blue alfalfa aphid reared on alfalfa and clover. PAR had a less dramatic effect (e.g., 30--39\% reduction in fecundity) on these traits of blue alfalfa aphid. In contrast, PAR and PASS increased the fitness of pea aphid subclones of one parent clone reared for three generations at 25 {$^\circ$}C on each of the three test plants. Without facultative bacteria, fecundity of the parent clone was reduced to a mean total of {$<$} 6 offspring per adult at this elevated temperature, but with PASS or PAR, mean total fecundity of its subclones was {$>$} 35. However, this ameliorative effect of facultative bacteria at 25 {$^\circ$}C was not found for two other sets of parent clones and their derived subclones. Alate production in pea aphids was significantly increased in large populations of two PASS- and PAR-positive subclones relative to their parent clones.

These rates are approximately two and three times faster than previously reported. The distances moved by species are greatest in studies showing the highest levels of warming, with average latitudinal shifts being generally sufficient to track temperature changes. However, individual species vary greatly in their rates of change, suggesting that the range shift of each species depends on multiple internal species traits and external drivers of change.

Documenting species ranges at ecologically meaningful scales through coverage completeness analysis is a fundamental step to track bees from species to communities. It may take decades before all existing bee specimens are digitized, so projections are needed now to focus future research and management efforts. From 1.923 million records, we created range maps for nearly 88\% (3158 species) of bee species in the contiguous United States, provided the first analysis of inventory completeness for digitized specimens of a major insect clade, and perhaps most important, estimated spatial completeness accounting for all known bee specimens in USA collections, including undigitized bee specimens. Completeness analyses were very low (3--37\%) across four examined spatial resolutions when using the currently available bee specimen records. Adding a subset of observations from community science data sources did not significantly increase completeness, and adding a projected 4.7 million undigitized specimens increased completeness by only an additional 12--13\%. Assessments of data, including projected specimen records, indicate persistent taxonomic and geographic deficiencies. In conjunction with expedited digitization, new inventories that integrate community science data with specimen-based documentation will be required to close these gaps. A combined effort involving both strategic inventories and accelerated digitization campaigns is needed for a more complete understanding of USA bee distributions.},

  abstract = {A mechanistic understanding of factors influencing the dispersal behavior of metamorph cane toads (Bufo marinus) has direct conservation relevance in Australia. These invasive anurans are toxic to native predators, and if we can predict their distribution across the landscape, we can also predict (and perhaps, manage) the scale of their impact. We propose that the major drivers of metamorph distribution are the risk of dehydration (restricting the young toads to moist substrates near pond margins) and biotic advantages to dispersal away from the pond (especially, less risk of cannibalism). To test this model, we investigated the influence of abiotic and biotic cues on the behavior of individual toads in the laboratory. Substrate moisture levels strongly influenced metamorph activity levels and habitat selection: dry substrates induced most metamorphs to remain near water. The only biotic cue to influence metamorph dispersal was proximity of a larger (cannibalistic) conspecific; a cannibal's presence at the pond margin caused most metamorphs to spend less time there, and as a consequence, to dehydrate more rapidly. Our results suggest that the spatial and temporal distribution of metamorph cane toads reflects a trade-off between competing risks: the danger of desiccation tends to keep young toads close to the pond margin in dry conditions, whereas the danger of cannibalism stimulates dispersal.

  abstract = {Urbanization adversely impacts biodiversity by reducing the quantity and quality of natural habitat areas. Additionally, the quality of natural habitat depends on its bio-physical characteristics (e.g., natural cover, impervious surfaces, urban tree canopy) as well as the functional traits of species inhabiting them (e.g., breeding/foraging habitat requirements). To better plan conservation of regional biodiversity in urbanized landscapes, it is therefore critical to assess the relationship between the landscape and the response of key Functional Trait Groups (FTGs) of species. To identify different FTGs of 116 avian species in the urbanized landscape of the Toronto region (Canada), we conducted a Functional Trait Analysis (FTA) using RLQ-fourth corner analysis. We focused on four species traits (diet, foraging, nesting, and territoriality) to identify the FTGs and their association with natural cover and landscape characteristics (landcover types, patch quality, habitat connectivity). Then, to predict FTG presence in relation to the landscape characteristics, we performed a Habitat Suitability Analysis (HSA). From this analysis, we found 21 avian FTGs with different habitat suitability values that correspond to forested patches and wetlands. The HSA for tree canopy, forest insectivore, and ground-nesting birds (or FTGs) have higher suitability values within forest patches, while aerial insectivores have higher suitability values in older residential neighborhoods indicating the value of the urban tree canopy. This methodological approach shows that by mapping habitat suitability by FTG one can identify strategic conservation areas that target multiple species, shifting efforts from a single species to a community-based functional focus. Our study highlights the conservation value of remnant and/or restored habitat patches in near urban and urban landscapes that help to maximize the persistence of regional avian biodiversity.},

  abstract = {In the context of global environmental change much of the focus has been on changing temperatures. However, patterns of rainfall and water availability have also been changing and are expected to continue doing so. In consequence, understanding the responses of insects to water availability is important, especially because it has a pronounced influence on insect activity, distribution patterns, and species richness. Here we therefore provide a critical review of key questions that either are being or need to be addressed in this field. First, an overview of insect behavioural responses to changing humidity conditions and the mechanisms underlying sensing of humidity variation is provided. The primary sensors in insects belong to the temperature receptor protein superfamily of cation channels. Temperature-activated transient receptor potential ion channels, or thermoTRPs, respond to a diverse range of stimuli and may be a primary integrator of sensory information, such as environmental temperature and moisture. Next we touch briefly on the components of water loss, drawing attention to a new, universal model of the water costs of gas exchange and its implications for responses to a warming, and in places drying, world. We also provide an overview of new understanding of the role of the sub-elytral chamber for water conservation, and developments in understanding of the role of cuticular hydrocarbons in preventing water loss. Because of an increasing focus on the molecular basis of responses to dehydration stress we touch briefly on this area, drawing attention to the role of sugars, heat shock proteins, aquaporins, and LEA proteins. Next we consider phenotypic plasticity or acclimation responses in insect water balance after initial exposures to altered humidity, temperature or nutrition. Although beneficial acclimation has been demonstrated in several instances, this is not always the case. Laboratory studies show that responses to selection for enhanced ability to survive water stress do evolve and that genetic variation for traits underlying such responses does exist in many species. However, in others, especially tropical, typically narrowly distributed species, this appears not to be the case. Using the above information we then demonstrate that habitat alteration, climate change, biological invasions, pollution and overexploitation are likely to be having considerable effects on insect populations mediated through physiological responses (or the lack thereof) to water stress, and that these effects may often be non-intuitive.},

Even though the mechanism influencing wing development in the three aphid morphs differs, the effects of parasitism were similar. Alatiform structures were completely inhibited in all three morphs when the initial attack took place in their first or early second stadium. The disruption of wing development also resulted in apterous/alate-intermediate forms when aphids were attacked from first (males and gynoparae) or early second (alate virginoparae) up to the fourth larval stadium. The fact that wing development was still disrupted when aphids with well developed wingbuds were parasitized indicates that the early stages of parasitization were influential. Thus, the morphogenetic effects may be exerted by the parasitoid egg or calyx fluid.},

  abstract = {Substantial global data show that many taxa are shifting their phenologies in response to climate change. For birds, migration arrival dates in breeding regions have been shifting earlier, and there is evidence that both evolutionary adaptation and behavioural flexibility influence these shifts. As more efficient flyers may be able to demonstrate more flexibility to respond to changing conditions during migratory flight, we hypothesize that differences among passerine species in flight efficiency, as reflected by morphology, may be associated with the magnitude of shifts in arrival date in response to climate warming. We applied a logistic model to 18 years of eBird data to estimate mean arrival date for 44 common passerines migrating to northeast North America. We then used linear mixed-effects models to estimate changes in mean arrival date and compared these changes to morphological proxies for flight efficiency and migratory distance using phylogenetic generalized least squares models. On average, passerine species shifted their arrival dates 0.120 days earlier each year, with 27 of the 44 species shifting to significantly earlier arrival times, and two shifting to significantly later ones. Of the 15 species with non-significant shifts, 13 trended toward earlier arrivals. Longer migration distances and higher wing aspect ratios were associated with greater shifts toward earlier arrivals. Migration distance and aspect ratio were also significantly correlated to each other. This suggests that changes in arrival date are affected by factors pertaining to migratory flight over long distances namely, flight efficiency and migration distance. These traits may be able predict the magnitude of arrival date shift, and by extension identify species that are most at risk to climate change due to inflexible arrival timing.},

  abstract = {Cannibals and their victims often share common resources and thus potentially compete. Smaller individuals are often competitively superior to larger ones because of size-dependent scaling of foraging and metabolic rates, while larger ones may use cannibalism to counter this competition. We study the interplay between cannibalism and competition using a size-structured population model in which all individuals consume a shared resource but in which larger ones may cannibalize smaller conspecifics. In this model, intercohort competition causes single-cohort cycles when cannibalism is absent. Moderate levels of cannibalism reduce intercohort competition, enabling coexistence of many cohorts. More voracious cannibalism, in combination with competition, produces large-amplitude cycles and a bimodal population size distribution with many small and few giant individuals. These coexisting ``dwarfs'' and ``giants'' have very different life histories, resulting from a reversal in importance of cannibalism and competition. The population structure at time of birth determines whether individuals suffer severe cannibalism, with the few survivors reaching giant sizes, or whether they suffer intense intracohort competition, with all individuals remaining small. These model results agree remarkably well with empirical data on perch population dynamics. We argue that the induction of cannibalistic giants in piscivorous fish is a population-dynamic emergent phenomenon that requires a combination of size-dependent cannibalism and competition.},

Flight fatigue occurs before all the fat reserves are used; possibly fat stored in parts of the body remote from the flight muscles cannot be mobilized rapidly enough to support continuous flight.Fat and glycogen reserves occur mainly in the fat-body cells of the thorax and abdomen; fat also occurs between the fibrils of the indirect flight muscles and glycogen along the surface of the fibres. Flight-exhausted insects have little or no fat in the thorax, but small deposits remain in the abdomen; little glycogen can be detected in culture aphids flown to exhaustion.},

  abstract = {The oleander aphid, Aphis nerii Boyer de Fonscolombe, feeds on milkweeds in the Apocynaceae family. In Kentucky, A.nerii colonizes several common Asclepias species and honeyvine milkweed, Cynanchum laeve (Michaux). Previous studies investigating whether and how host plant characteristics influence A.nerii fitness have produced conflicting results. Our observations suggested that A.nerii more readily colonized C.laeve than Asclepias species. We hypothesized that aphid fitness differed among host plant species having different characteristics, and specifically, that A.nerii performance would be greatest on host plants having low cardenolide concentrations and few physical defenses. Physical and chemical characteristics were measured on C.laeve and three Asclepias species. Laboratory and field experiments were conducted to compare A.nerii performance among these four milkweed species in the absence of natural enemies. Changes in aphid densities over time were examined in the presence of natural enemies. Plant characteristics and aphid performance were found to differ among milkweed species. In the absence of natural enemies, A.nerii performance was best on C.laeve. When exposed to natural enemies, A.nerii densities remained higher on A.incarnata and C. laeve than on A.syriaca and A.tuberosa. Physical differences between C.laeve, a vining milkweed, and tested Asclepias species may increase suitability of honeyvine milkweed for A.nerii colonization. Our results suggest that C.laeve may rely more on tolerance and less on nonpreference or antibiosis resistance to herbivores.},

Two major gaps were identified: (1) a need to compare and contrast the success (and the situations that induce success) of CBM programs which present sound evidence of citizen scientists influencing positive environmental changes in the local ecosystems they monitor and (2) more case studies showing use of CBM data by decision-makers or the barriers to linkages and how these might be overcome.

  abstract = {The resources available to support conservation work, whether time or money, are limited. Decision makers need methods to help them identify the optimal allocation of limited resources to meet conservation goals, and decision analysis is uniquely suited to assist with the development of such methods. In recent years, a number of case studies have been described that examine optimal conservation decisions under fiscal constraints; here we develop methods to look at other types of constraints, including limited staff and regulatory deadlines. In the US, Section Seven consultation, an important component of protection under the federal Endangered Species Act, requires that federal agencies overseeing projects consult with federal biologists to avoid jeopardizing species. A benefit of consultation is negotiation of project modifications that lessen impacts on species, so staff time allocated to consultation supports conservation. However, some offices have experienced declining staff, potentially reducing the efficacy of consultation. This is true of the US Fish and Wildlife Service's Washington Fish and Wildlife Office (WFWO) and its consultation work on federally-threatened bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus). To improve effectiveness, WFWO managers needed a tool to help allocate this work to maximize conservation benefits. We used a decision-analytic approach to score projects based on the value of staff time investment, and then identified an optimal decision rule for how scored projects would be allocated across bins, where projects in different bins received different time investments. We found that, given current staff, the optimal decision rule placed 80\% of informal consultations (those where expected effects are beneficial, insignificant, or discountable) in a short bin where they would be completed without negotiating changes. The remaining 20\% would be placed in a long bin, warranting an investment of seven days, including time for negotiation. For formal consultations (those where expected effects are significant), 82\% of projects would be placed in a long bin, with an average time investment of 15days. The WFWO is using this decision-support tool to help allocate staff time. Because workload allocation decisions are iterative, we describe a monitoring plan designed to increase the tool's efficacy over time. This work has general application beyond Section Seven consultation, in that it provides a framework for efficient investment of staff time in conservation when such time is limited and when regulatory deadlines prevent an unconstrained approach.},

While openness to thinking about urban ecosystems has increased in recent years, there remain fundamental gaps in our knowledge. For example, recent research has examined the impact of urban--rural gradients on ecological conditions, but major voids exist regarding the relationship between urban development patterns and land cover heterogeneity, particularly for new forms of urbanization. This article attempts to address some of these gaps by examining the relationship between urban pattern and land cover in the greater Toronto area (GTA). In particular, measures of urban pattern that reflect aspects of development density, grain and function, as well as socio-economic characteristics, are systematically analyzed in relation to land cover heterogeneity. The regression analysis shows that multiple components of urban development pattern and socio-economic conditions are correlated with vegetated land covers, while urban density variables are not related. These results indicate more detailed representations of urban pattern should be incorporated into future human--environmental interaction studies in cities.},

Because of their smaller size, lighter color, greater tendency to remain motionless in the presence of the predator, greater ability to avoid capture when attacked, and predicted lower profitability as prey, N. lunata and N. petrunkevitchi were estimated to have the lowest prey risk and greatest chance of coexisting with insectivorous fishes in nature. The 2 largest notonectids, N. irrorata and N. insulata, both highly melanistic and rapidly discovered by foraging sunfishes, were judged to be the most susceptible to predation by large fishes. The presence of vegetation as a potential refuge tended to decrease prey risk but did not significantly alter the relative risk among the prey species. Finally, the relative prey risk measured in the laboratory was consistent with the general distribution of these species in relation to fishes in local habitats.

Contributions from many of the leading researchers in dragonfly biology offer new perspectives and paradigms as well as additional, unpublished, data. The editor has carefully assembled a mix of theoretical and applied chapters (including those addressing conservation and monitoring) and achieves a balance of emerging and established research topics, providing suggestions for future study in each case. This accessible text is not about dragonflies per se but an essential source of knowledge that describes how different sets of evolutionary and ecological principles/ideas have been tested on a particular taxon. It will therefore be suitable for graduate students and researchers in entomology, evolutionary biology, population and behavioural ecology, and conservation biology. It will of course be of particular interest and use to those working on insects and an indispensable reference text for odonate biologists.},

  abstract = {Recent climate change is recognized as a main cause of shifts in geographical distributions of species. The impacts of climate change may be aggravated by habitat fragmentation, causing regional or large scale extinctions. However, we propose that climate change also may diminish the effects of fragmentation by enhancing flight behaviour and dispersal of ectothermic species like butterflies. We show that under weather conditions associated with anticipated climate change, behavioural components of dispersal of butterflies are enhanced, and colonization frequencies increase. In a field study, we recorded flight behaviour and mobility of four butterfly species: two habitat generalists (Coenonympha pamphilus; Maniola jurtina) and two specialists (Melitaea athalia; Plebejus argus), under different weather conditions. Flying bout duration generally increased with temperature and decreased with cloudiness. Proportion of time spent flying decreased with cloudiness. Net displacement generally increased with temperature. When butterflies fly longer, start flying more readily and fly over longer distances, we expect dispersal propensity to increase. Monitoring data showed that colonization frequencies moreover increased with temperature and radiation and decreased with cloudiness. Increased dispersal propensity at local scale might therefore lower the impact of habitat fragmentation on the distribution at a regional scale. Synergetic effects of climate change and habitat fragmentation on population dynamics and species distributions might therefore appear to be more complex than previously assumed.},

  abstract = {Leaving a population without having information about the surrounding areas is highly risky. Candidates for dispersal may reduce these risks by making decisions based on the level of connectivity between patches, e.g., through immigrants. The benefits of information acquisition may vary within a population according to the dispersal cause and the phenotype of the candidate disperser. For instance, kin-based dispersers should be prepared to accept higher dispersal cost than individuals leaving for competition with congeners, and individuals of better condition should better deal with the costs of dispersing. We investigated whether the use of information obtained from immigrants depended on the reason for dispersal and the phenotype of individuals in common lizards (Lacerta vivipara). Dispersal decisions with respect to connection status depended on the cause of dispersal and on body mass. When intraspecific competition was the driving force behind dispersal, the information carried by immigrants allowed candidate dispersers to decrease uncertainty about the success of dispersal. Therefore, larger individuals dispersed when connectivity was low, whereas smaller individuals dispersed when connectivity was high. When kin competition dominated, dispersers did not adjust their dispersal decisions on the basis of information about the existence of surrounding populations, and larger individuals dispersed whatever the connectivity. These results provide support for the hypothesis that kin competition is one of the factors driving colonization.},

  abstract = {Roads have been associated with decreased reproductive success and biodiversity in avian communities and increased physiological stress in adult birds. Alternatively, roads may also increase food availability and reduce predator pressure. Previous studies have focused on adult birds, but nestlings may also be susceptible to the detrimental impacts of roads. We examined the effects of proximity to a road on nestling glucocorticoid activity and growth in the mountain white-crowned sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys oriantha). Additionally, we examined several possible indirect factors that may influence nestling corticosterone (CORT) activity secretion in relation to roads. These indirect effects include parental CORT activity, nest-site characteristics, and parental provisioning. And finally, we assessed possible fitness consequences of roads through measures of fledging success. Nestlings near roads had increased CORT activity, elevated at both baseline and stress-induced levels. Surprisingly, these nestlings were also bigger. Generally, greater corticosterone activity is associated with reduced growth. However, the hypothalamic--pituitary--adrenal axis matures through the nestling period (as nestlings get larger, HPA-activation is greater). Although much of the variance in CORT responses was explained by body size, nestling CORT responses were higher close to roads after controlling for developmental differences. Indirect effects of roads may be mediated through paternal care. Nestling CORT responses were correlated with paternal CORT responses and paternal provisioning increased near roads. Hence, nestlings near roads may be larger due to increased paternal attentiveness. And finally, nest predation was higher for nests close to the road. Roads have apparent costs for white-crowned sparrow nestlings -- increased predation, and apparent benefits -- increased size. The elevation in CORT activity seems to reflect both increased size (benefit) and elevation due to road proximity (cost). Whether or not roads are good or bad for nestlings remains equivocal. However, it is clear that roads affect nestlings; how or if these effects influence adult survival or reproduction remains to be elucidated.},

In this study, we report on the effects of spider predators on the mortality, dispersal, and spatial population dynamics of Prokelisia crocea planthoppers (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) in a prairie landscape. Based on a three-generation survey of host-plant patches (Spartina pectinata; Poaceae), the density of cursorial and web-building spiders declined significantly with increasing patch size (a pattern the opposite of that for the planthopper). Independent of patch size effects, an increase in the density of web-building and cursorial spiders had a negative effect on planthopper density in one of three generations each. Finally, the likelihood of extinction of local (patch) populations of planthoppers increased significantly with an increase in the density of web-building spiders. Planthoppers in small host-plant patches with high densities of web-building spiders were especially at risk of extinction. To evaluate whether spider effects on planthopper spatial dynamics were mediated by predation and/or spider-induced dispersal, we performed a field experiment in which host-plant patches were either caged or left open and received one of three spider density treatments (removal, ambient levels, or high = triple ambient levels). For the caged patches, there was a nonsignificant decline in planthopper recaptures with increasing spider density, suggesting that mortality effects of spiders on planthoppers were weak. In contrast, planthopper recaptures in open patches declined by 85\% between the removal and high spider treatments. This significant decline was mostly attributed to spider-induced emigration. We conclude that, at high spider densities, spiders are likely to have a greater impact on planthopper densities through induced emigration than consumption. Because small cordgrass patches support high spider densities and favor high planthopper emigration rates, the nonlethal effects of spiders may play a very important role in determining critical patch size, source--sink properties of cordgrass patches, and the spatial distribution and spread of planthoppers.},

Increasing precipitation caused late-season flight activity of A. glycines and early-season activity of R. padi to shift earlier, while increasing temperature did the same for early-season activity of A. glycines and R. maidis. In these cases, precipitation and temperature exhibited directionally similar, but independent, effects. However, precipitation sometimes mediated temperature effects in complex ways. At relatively low temperatures, greater precipitation generally caused late-season flights of R. maidis to occur earlier. However, this pattern was reversed at higher temperatures with precipitation delaying late-season activity. In contrast, greater precipitation delayed peak flights of R. padi at lower temperatures, but caused them to occur earlier at higher temperatures. So, in these two cases the interactive effects of precipitation on temperature were mirror images of one another. When projecting future aphid flight phenology, models that excluded precipitation covariates consistently underpredicted the degree of phenological advance for A. glycines and R. padi, and underpredicted the degree of phenological delay for R. maidis under expected future climates. Overall, we found broad evidence that changing patterns of aphid flight phenology could only be understood by considering both temperature and precipitation changes. In our study region, temperature and precipitation are expected to increase in tandem, but these correlations will be reversed elsewhere. This reinforces the need to include both main and interactive effects of precipitation and temperature when seeking to accurately predict how pest pressure will change with a changing climate.},

In the first two experiments, larvae that were either similar or different in size were paired to examine the potential for intra- and intercohort cannibalism. In the third experiment, size structure of an assemblage of larvae and water temperature were manipulated to explore the seasonal dynamics of cannibalism. Cannibalism was common between individuals that differed in body size by one or more instars. Cannibalism also occurred between individuals similar in size but the rate varied across developmental stages. Results suggest that cannibalism may be most common when water temperatures are warm and late-instar larvae are present at high densities. These results highlight the importance of intra- and intercohort cannibalism as factors that can influence the population dynamics of generalist predators.},

Here we examine how climate change may affect the occurrences of tick species in Africa and alter the suitability of habitat outside Africa for African ticks. Location Africa and the world. Methods We predicted continental and global changes in habitat suitability for each of 73 African tick species, using multiple regression models in different climate change scenarios that cover a wide range of uncertainty. Results Global habitat suitability improves for nearly all tick species under each of a representative range of eight climate change scenarios. Depending on the scenario, African tick species experience an average increase in global habitat suitability of between 1 million and 9 million square kilometres between 1990 and 2100. Main conclusions The potential for successful translocations of ticks and their pathogens from Africa to the rest of the world is likely to increase over the next 100 years. Although the general trend is one of range expansion, there are winners and losers among tick species in each scenario, suggesting that tick community composition will be disrupted substantially by climate change. If this is also typical of other invertebrates, then climate change will disrupt not only the geographic location of communities but also their structure. Changes in tick communities are also likely to influence tick-borne pathogens.},

  abstract = {Prevalence of parasites in wild animals may follow ecogeographic patterns, under the influence of climatic factors and macroecological features. One of the largest scale biological patterns on Earth is the latitudinal diversity gradient; however, latitudinal gradients may also exist regarding the frequency of interspecific interactions such as the prevalence of parasitism in host populations. Dragonflies and damselflies (order Odonata) are hosts of a wide range of ecto- and endoparasites, interactions that can be affected by environmental factors that shape their occurrence and distribution, such as climatic variation, ultraviolet radiation and vegetation structure. Here, we retrieved data from the literature on parasites of Odonata, represented by 90 populations infected by ectoparasites (water mites) and 117 populations infected by endoparasites (intestinal gregarines). To test whether there is a latitudinal and bioclimatic gradient in the prevalence of water mites and gregarines parasitizing Odonata, we applied Bayesian phylogenetic comparative models. We found that prevalence of ectoparasites was partially associated with latitude, showing the opposite pattern from our expectations -- prevalence was reduced at lower latitudes. Prevalence of endoparasites was not affected by latitude. While prevalence of water mites was also positively associated with vegetation biomass and climatic stability, we found no evidence of the effect of bioclimatic variables on the prevalence of gregarines. Our study suggests that infection by ectoparasites of dragonflies and damselflies is driven by latitudinal and bioclimatic variables. We add evidence of the role of global-scale biological patterns in shaping biodiversity, suggesting that parasitic organisms may prove reliable sources of information about climate change and its impact on ecological interactions.},

To explore the interaction of community structure with host--parasite dynamics, we model the invasion of stable communities of varying size by a parasite. The communities are generated with random interaction coefficients and connectance 0.5. Each community is invaded by parasites with different values of virulence (disease-induced host mortality rate), specificity and transmission rate. The result of each invasion is determined by numerically simulating the dynamics of the community. We classify the outcomes by whether the parasite successfully establishes in the focal host population(s), and, if so, by the proportion of host and non-host species that go extinct as a result of the parasite's introduction. We discuss how the structure of the community and the interaction between hosts and other species affect several important processes of disease ecology: the density threshold for parasite invasion, extinction cascades caused by the parasite, and the frequency of extinctions of hosts and non-hosts. In our simulated communities, non-host species went extinct more frequently than hosts, suggesting the importance of the community context of disease. In some cases, the parasite's invasion induced regular population cycles in the previously stable community.},

Automated and non-invasive systems offer precision and detection ease and may improve animal welfare. This study was conducted to create a repository of images and videos of sows with different locomotion scores. Our goal is to develop a computer vision model for automatically identifying specific points on the sow's body. The automatic identification and ability to track specific body areas, will allow us to conduct kinematic studies with the aim of facilitating the detection of lameness using deep learning. The video database was collected on a pig farm with a scenario built to allow filming of sows in locomotion with different lameness scores. Two stereo cameras were used to record 2D videos images. Thirteen locomotion experts assessed the videos using the Locomotion Score System developed by Zinpro Corporation. From this annotated repository, computational models were trained and tested using the open-source deep learning-based animal pose tracking framework SLEAP (Social LEAP Estimates Animal Poses). The top-performing models were constructed using the LEAP architecture to accurately track 6 (lateral view) and 10 (dorsal view) skeleton keypoints. The architecture achieved average precisions values of 0.90 and 0.72, average distances of 6.83 and 11.37 in pixel, and similarities of 0.94 and 0.86 for the lateral and dorsal views, respectively. These computational models are proposed as a Precision Livestock Farming tool and method for identifying and estimating postures in pigs automatically and objectively. The 2D video image repository with different pig locomotion scores can be used as a tool for teaching and research. Based on our skeleton keypoint classification results, an automatic system could be developed. This could contribute to the objective assessment of locomotion scores in sows, improving their welfare.},

Much work has focused on understanding genetic and physiological immunity against parasites, but hosts can also use behaviors to avoid infection, reduce parasite growth or alleviate disease symptoms. It is increasingly recognized that such behaviors are common in insects, providing strong protection against parasites and parasitoids. We review the current evidence for behavioral immunity in insects, present a framework for investigating such behavior, and emphasize that behavioral immunity may act through indirect rather than direct fitness benefits. We also discuss the implications for host-parasite co-evolution, local adaptation, and the evolution of non-behavioral physiological immune systems. Finally, we argue that the study of behavioral immunity in insects has much to offer for investigations in vertebrates, in which this topic has traditionally been studied.},

Citizen science and the resulting ecological data can be viewed as a public good that is generated through increasingly collaborative tools and resources, while supporting public participation in science and Earth stewardship.},

We found and monitored 152 sparrow nests over 3~years and captured 123 sparrows over 2~years for standardized stress series experiments. Distance of a nest to the road was associated with reproductive success, and low success near the road was primarily because of high rates of nest desertion. The probability of a nest succeeding rose with increasing distance from road up to 40~m, but nests beyond 40~m experienced lower nest success, possibly because of increased predation. Nests at intermediate distance were approximately twice as likely to succeed (70\% survival rate) as those near (36\% survival) or far (37\% survival) from the road. Stress response of male sparrows subjected to a standardized field stress protocol was elevated within 20~m of the road (38.34 {\textpm} 5.76~ng/ml) compared to those at greater distances (23.89 {\textpm} 2.01~ng/ml). Our study is the first to document the association between the distance to a road and blood corticosterone levels in any bird species. The results present strong evidence of impacts of a road on nest success of a migratory songbird. This relatively low-traffic, low-speed road clearly presents problems, even for a bird species not thought to be sensitive to disturbance.},

Lower-order streams may contain up to 50 species (including benthic and hyporheic forms) and small springs up to 20 crenobiont species. 2 Water mites are grouped into 8 superfamilies, 50 families, 300 genera containing more than 5 000 species. Representatives of all superfamilies (about 3 000 species worldwide) occur in lotic ecosystems, although most lotic species belong to the Hydryphantoidea, Lebertioidea and Hygrobatoidea. Identification of water mite families, genera and subgenera, throughout the world, is possible using taxonomic publications. Keys to species level are also available but mainly for local faunas. Descriptions of larvae and deutonymphs are rare. 3 The life cycle of the Hydrachnidia is unique among the Acari and is similar to that of holometabolous insects, with a heteromorphic parasitic/phoretic larva and two pupa-like resting stages. The larva parasitises mainly insect hosts with apparently no strict host-specificity. Deutonymphs and adults are voracious predators feeding mainly on insect eggs, insect larvae and microcrustaceans. In some cases, water mite parasitism and predation may substantially affect the structure of lotic communities. 4 Most species show a high degree of habitat/microhabitat specialization. Temperature, current-speed, substratum type, physiographic and geomorphological factors are the major determinants of species composition in water mite communities. 5 The complex, fully aquatic, life cycle and multilevel biocoenotic interactions make water mites well suited for the detection of physical and chemical disturbances to lotic ecosystems. 6 Future research should address the distribution, biology, autecology, community dynamics and ecological interactions of lotic water mites.},

Over 6,000 species have been described worldwide, representing 57 families, 81 subfamilies and more than 400 genera. The article analyzes extant water mite diversity and biogeography. Data on distribution and species richness of water mites are substantial but still far from complete. Many parts of the world are poorly investigated, Oriental and Afrotropical regions in particular. Moreover, information among different freshwater habitats is unbalanced with springs and interstitial waters disproportionately unrepresented. Therefore, more than 10,000 species could be reasonably expected to occur in inland waters worldwide. Based on available information, the Palaearctic region represents one of the better investigated areas with the highest number of species recorded (1,642 species). More than 1,000 species have been recorded in each of the Neotropical (1,305 species) and Nearctic regions (1,025 species). Known species richness is lower in Afrotropical (787 species) and Australasian (694 species) regions, and lowest in the Oriental region (554 species). The total number of genera is not correlated with species richness and is distinctly higher in the Neotropical (164 genera); genus richness is similar in the Palaearctic, Nearctic and Australasian regions (128--131 genera) and is lower in the Afrotropical and Oriental regions with 110 and 94 genera, respectively. A mean number of about three genera per family occur in the Palaeartic, Nearctic and Oriental while an average of more than four genera characterizes the families of Australasian and Afrotropical regions and more than five genera those of the Neotropical. Australasian fauna is also characterized by the highest percentage of endemic genera (62\%), followed by Neotropical (50.6\%) and Afrotropical (47.2\%) regions. Lower values are recorded for the Palaearctic (26.9\%), Oriental (24.4\%) and Nearctic (21.4\%). The Palaearctic and Nearctic have the highest faunistic similarity, some minor affinities are also evident for the generic diversification of Holarctic and Oriental families. The faunas of Southern Hemisphere bioregions are more distinct and characterized by the presence of ancient Gondwanan clades with a regional diversification particularly evident in the Neotropics and Australasia. This scenario of water mite diversity and distribution reflect the basic vicariance pattern, isolation, phylogenetic diversification, recent climatic vicissitudes and episodes of dispersal between adjacent land masses together with extant ecological factors can be evoked to explain distribution patterns at a global scale.},

Recognizing the need for a precise tool to capture insect flight, we developed an Arduino-integrated flight mill that offers researchers affordability, accuracy, and adaptability. Our flight mill was rigorously tested on two insect species, Protaetia brevitarsis seulensis and Polygonia c-aureum, and proved effective in recording their unique flight patterns. Key to the precision of our flight mill is the integration of advanced materials, such as polytetrafluoroethylene, which reduces friction, and the incorporation of magnetic sensing for meticulous data capture. These design choices ensure that the natural flight speed of the insect is replicated with minimal disturbance. Additionally, the implementation of a dedicated R script for data analysis provides researchers with a comprehensive platform, allowing them to delve deeply into various metrics, visualize patterns, and make informed conclusions. However, our flight mill is not without challenges. Mastery of the Arduino platform and R programming environment is essential for optimal use, which could pose barriers for those unfamiliar with these platforms. Moreover, although carefully designed, the mounting mechanism may still influence the natural behavior of the insect. Despite these challenges, the potential applications of our flight mill are myriad. From basic entomological research to practical applications in pest management and conservation, its versatility is evident. The adaptability of the tool also makes it an excellent resource in educational settings, offering students hands-on experience in studying insect behavior.},

  abstract = {Ecological stability is touted as a complex and multifaceted concept, including components such as variability, resistance, resilience, persistence and robustness. Even though a complete appreciation of the effects of perturbations on ecosystems requires the simultaneous measurement of these multiple components of stability, most ecological research has focused on one or a few of those components analysed in isolation. Here, we present a new view of ecological stability that recognises explicitly the non-independence of components of stability. This provides an approach for simplifying the concept of stability. We illustrate the concept and approach using results from a field experiment, and show that the effective dimensionality of ecological stability is considerably lower than if the various components of stability were unrelated. However, strong perturbations can modify, and even decouple, relationships among individual components of stability. Thus, perturbations not only increase the dimensionality of stability but they can also alter the relationships among components of stability in different ways. Studies that focus on single forms of stability in isolation therefore risk underestimating significantly the potential of perturbations to destabilise ecosystems. In contrast, application of the multidimensional stability framework that we propose gives a far richer understanding of how communities respond to perturbations.},

In nature, however, the thermal environment is more complex. Aerial exposure and the unpredictable nature of thermal stress during low tides may be critical factors in defining the thermal physiology of intertidal organisms. In the fingered limpet, Lottia digitalis, we investigated whether upper temperature tolerance and thermal sensitivity were influenced by the pattern of fluctuation with which thermal stress was applied. Specifically, we examined whether there was a differential response (measured as cardiac performance) to repeated heat stress of a constant and predictable magnitude compared with heat stress applied in a stochastic and unpredictable nature. We also investigated differences in cellular metabolism and damage following immersion for insights into biochemical mechanisms of tolerance. Upper temperature tolerance increased with aerial exposure, but no significant differences were found between predictable treatments of varying magnitudes (13{$^\circ$}C versus 24{$^\circ$}C versus 32{$^\circ$}C). Significant differences in thermal tolerance were found between unpredictable trials with different heating patterns. There were no significant differences among treatments in basal citrate synthase activity, glycogen content, oxidative stress or antioxidants. Our results suggest that aerial exposure and recent thermal history, paired with relief from high low-tide temperatures, are important factors modulating the capacity of limpets to deal with thermal stress.},

On one hand, behavioral flexibility allows for an immediate response of colonizers to novel environments, which is critical to population establishment and persistence. On the other hand, integrated sets of behaviors that display limited flexibility can enhance invasion success by coupling behaviors with dispersal strategies that are especially important during natural range expansions. Direct observations of colonization events are required to determine the mechanisms underlying changes in behavior associated with colonization, but such observations are rare. Here, we studied changes in aggression on a large temporal and spatial scale across populations of two sister taxa of bluebirds (Sialia) to show that coupling of aggression and dispersal strongly facilitated the range expansion of western bluebirds across the northwestern United States over the last 30 years. We show that biased dispersal of highly aggressive males to the invasion front allowed western bluebirds to displace less aggressive mountain bluebirds. However, once mountain bluebirds were excluded, aggression of western bluebirds decreased rapidly across consecutive generations in concordance with local selection on highly heritable aggressive behavior. Further, the observed adaptive microevolution of aggression was accelerated by the link between dispersal propensity and aggression. Importantly, our results show that behavioral changes among populations were not caused by behavioral flexibility and instead strongly implicate adaptive integration of dispersal and aggression in facilitating the ongoing and rapid reciprocal range change of these species in North America.},

The often species-specific nature of these behavioural responses to roads and traffic suggest that morphological, ecological, life-history and behavioural traits could be useful in explaining and predicting these responses. Trait-based predictive models have been used to assess extinction risk, land use impacts, and road mortality. Here we present the first, to our knowledge, test of their potential to address animal road avoidance. We studied the fleeing responses and spatial distribution in relation to roads of diverse ungulate species across three South African protected areas. Our results show that smaller, solitary species with non-grazing food habits are more likely to flee in response to presence of a vehicle. None of the tested traits showed a clear relationship based on biological hypotheses with initial distance to roads and tolerance distance to vehicles (used to describe behavioural avoidance towards roads and vehicles, respectively). However, we found significant effects that supported proposed methodological hypotheses. Our results show the potential to use traits as indicators of vehicle and traffic avoidance. Obtaining behavioural avoidance data in the field for many species and areas can be time consuming, but here we show it may be possible to use available trait data to generally predict species responses. This could be useful for initial species risk assessments.},

However, interactions with other organisms, such as pollinators, also have the potential to influence plant distributions. To investigate this, we developed niche models for 32 plant taxa that have specialized pollination systems and which are native to a biodiversity hotspot (South Africa). We found that the distributions of these taxa are best explained by a combination of biotic (pollinators) and abiotic factors, rather than by abiotic factors alone. For approximately 66\% of these plant taxa, pollinator distributions were the factor that provided the best predictor of their niches. Furthermore, co-occurrence of these plants and their pollinators was generally not explained solely by shared abiotic niches, and thus probably reflects broad-scale positive ecological interactions. These results are consistent with the proposal that pollinator distributions may constrain plant distributions and highlight the general potential for species distributions to be shaped by positive interactions with other species. This has important consequences for predicting how distributions of species might change in the face of loss of their key mutualists.},

We review the current knowledge of coextinction by: (i) considering plausible explanations for the discrepancy between predicted and observed coextinction rates; (ii) exploring the potential consequences of coextinctions; (iii) discussing the interactions and synergies between coextinction and other drivers of species loss, particularly climate change; and (iv) suggesting the way forward for understanding the phenomenon of coextinction, which may well be the most insidious threat to global biodiversity.},

  abstract = {The challenge Understanding how biotic interactions affect species' geographical ranges, biodiversity patterns and ecological responses to environmental change is one of the most pressing challenges in macroecology. Extensive efforts are underway to detect signals of biotic interactions in macroecological data. However, efforts are limited by bias in the taxa and spatial scale for which occurrence data are available and by difficulty in ascribing causality to co-occurrence patterns. Moreover, we are not necessarily looking in the right places; analyses are largely ad hoc, depending on availability of data, rather than focusing on regions, taxa, ecosystems or interaction types where biotic interactions might affect species' geographical ranges most strongly. Unpicking biotic interactions We suggest that macroecology would benefit from the recognition that abiotic conditions alter two key components of biotic interaction strength: frequency and intensity. We outline how and why variation in biotic interaction strength occurs, explore the implications for species' geographical ranges and discuss the challenges inherent in quantifying these effects. In addition, we explore the role of behavioural flexibility in mediating biotic interactions potentially to mitigate impacts of environmental change. New data We argue that macroecology should take advantage of ``independent'' data on the strength of biotic interactions measured by other disciplines, in order to capture a far wider array of taxa, locations and interaction types than are typically studied in macroecology. Data on biotic interactions are readily available from community, disease, microbial and parasite ecology, evolution, palaeontology, invasion biology and agriculture, but most are yet to be exploited within macroecology. Integrating biotic interaction strength data into macroecology Harmonization of data across interdisciplinary sources, taxa and interaction types could be achieved by breaking down interactions into elements that contribute to frequency and intensity. This would allow quantitative biotic interaction data to be incorporated directly into models of species distributions and macroecological patterns.},

This mosaic of a large and growing urban population and prime agricultural land creates particular challenges for soil and water resource management. While urban areas continue to expand in southern Ontario, changes in agricultural cover and practices within the headwaters are also important to consider. There have been dramatic increases in tile-drained cash crop production (principally grain, corn, and soybean) in southern Ontario over the past few decades, largely at the expense of pasture and forage land. Urban populations will continue to expand into the future, but there is considerable scope for further agricultural change in the headwaters as well. Expansions in urban land cover and intensification of agriculture affect the hydrologic response to extreme events as well as water quality and nitrate leaching in particular. It is important to consider the effects of shifts in both types of land cover on stream flow and water quality in the variable landscape and climatic conditions of the lower Great Lakes.},

We summarize impacts of the adelgid on these forest foundation species; review previous models and analyses of adelgid spread dynamics; and examine how previous forecasts of adelgid spread and ecosystem dynamics compare with current conditions. The adelgid has reset successional sequences, homogenized biological diversity at landscape scales, altered hydrological dynamics, and changed forest stands from carbon sinks into carbon sources. A new model better predicts spread of the adelgid in the south and west of the range of hemlock, but still under-predicts its spread in the north and east. Whether these underpredictions result from inadequately modeling accelerating climate change or accounting for people inadvertently moving the adelgid into new locales needs further study. Ecosystem models of adelgid-driven hemlock dynamics have consistently forecast that forest carbon stocks will be little affected by the shift from hemlock to early-successional mixed hardwood stands, but these forecasts have assumed that the intermediate stages will remain carbon sinks. New forecasting models of adelgid-driven hemlock decline should account for observed abrupt changes in carbon flux and ongoing and accelerating human-driven land-use and climatic changes.},

Progress requires determining which processes and species differences are most important for coexistence when multiple processes operate and species differ in many ways. Modern coexistence theory (MCT), formalised by Chesson, holds out the promise of doing that, but empirical applications remain scarce. We argue that MCT's mathematical complexity and subtlety have obscured the simplicity and power of its underlying ideas and hindered applications. We present a general computational approach that extends our previous solution for the storage effect to all of standard MCT's spatial and temporal coexistence mechanisms, and also process-defined mechanisms amenable to direct study such as resource partitioning, indirect competition, and life history trade-offs. The main components are a method to partition population growth rates into contributions from different mechanisms and their interactions, and numerical calculations in which some mechanisms are removed and others retained. We illustrate how our approach handles features that have not been analysed in the standard framework through several case studies: competing diatom species under fluctuating temperature, plant--soil feedbacks in grasslands, facilitation in a beach grass community, and niche differences with independent effects on recruitment, survival and growth in sagebrush steppe.},

Many harbor symbiotic bacteria, but very few of these bacteria have been genetically engineered.           ,              ABSTRACT                            Aphids are global agricultural pests and important models for bacterial symbiosis. To date, none of the native symbionts of aphids have been genetically manipulated, which limits our understanding of how they interact with their hosts.               Serratia symbiotica               CWBI-2.3               T               is a culturable, gut-associated bacterium isolated from the black bean aphid. Closely related               Serratia symbiotica               strains are facultative aphid endosymbionts that are vertically transmitted from mother to offspring during embryogenesis. We demonstrate that CWBI-2.3               T               can be genetically engineered using a variety of techniques, plasmids, and gene expression parts. Then, we use fluorescent protein expression to track the dynamics with which CWBI-2.3               T               colonizes the guts of multiple aphid species, and we measure how this bacterium affects aphid fitness. Finally, we show that we can induce heterologous gene expression from engineered CWBI-2.3               T               in living aphids. These results inform the development of CWBI-2.3               T               for aphid paratransgenesis, which could be used to study aphid biology and to enable future agricultural technologies.                                         IMPORTANCE               Insects have remarkably diverse and integral roles in global ecosystems. Many harbor symbiotic bacteria, but very few of these bacteria have been genetically engineered. Aphids are major agricultural pests and an important model system for the study of symbiosis. This work describes methods for engineering a culturable aphid symbiont,               Serratia symbiotica               CWBI-2.3               T               . These approaches and genetic tools could be used in the future to implement new paradigms for the biological study and control of aphids.},

  abstract = {Host plant range is arguably one of the most important factors shaping microbial communities associated with insect herbivores. However, it is unclear whether host plant specialization limits microbial community diversity or to what extent herbivores sharing a common host plant evolve similar microbiomes. To investigate whether variation in host plant range influences the assembly of core herbivore symbiont populations we compared bacterial diversity across three milkweed aphid species (Aphis nerii, Aphis asclepiadis, Myzocallis asclepiadis) feeding on a common host plant (Asclepias syriaca) using 16S rRNA metabarcoding. Overall, although there was significant overlap in taxa detected across all three aphid species (i.e. similar composition), some structural differences were identified within communities. Each aphid species harbored bacterial communities that varied in terms of richness and relative abundance of key symbionts. However, bacterial community diversity did not vary with degree of aphid host plant specialization. Interestingly, the narrow specialist A. asclepiadis harbored significantly higher relative abundances of the facultative symbiont Arsenophonus compared to the other two aphid species. Although many low abundance microbes were shared across all milkweed aphids, key differences in symbiotic partnerships were observed that could influence host physiology or additional ecological variation in traits that are microbially-mediated. Overall, this study suggests overlap in host plant range can select for taxonomically similar microbiomes across herbivore species, but variation in core aphid symbionts within these communities may still occur.},

While climate is known to play a role in species distributions, biotic interactions such as competition also affect range limits. Furthermore, climatic and biotic controls of ranges may vary in strength across life stages, implying complex range shift dynamics with climate change. {$\bullet$} Methods: We quantified climatic and competitive influences on growth of juvenile and adult trees of three conifer species on Mt. Rainier, Washington, United States. We collected annual growth data of these trees, which we compared to the competitive environment and annual climate (100 years of data) experienced by each individual. {$\bullet$} Key results: We found that the relationships between growth and climate and between growth and competition differed by life stage and location. Growth was sensitive to heavy snowpack and cold temperatures at high elevation upper limits (treeline), but growth was poorly explained by climate in low elevation closed-canopy forests. Competitive effects on growth were more important for saplings than adults, but did not become more important at either upper or lower range limits. {$\bullet$} Conclusions: In all, our results suggest that range shifts under climate change will differ at leading vs. trailing edges. At treeline, warmer temperatures will lead to increased growth and likely to range expansion. However, climate change will have less dramatic effects in low elevation closed-canopy forest communities, where growth is less strongly limited by climate, especially at young life stages.},

  abstract = {Climatic warming has induced marked shifts in the geographical distribution and seasonal phenology of many species, although the impacts of climatic changes on the interactions between species across trophic levels are far less well known. Freshwater microcosms were used to test the effect of temperature on the life history traits of a prey species, the fairy shrimp Chirocephalus diaphanus (Anostraca), the abundance of a predator, the microcrustacean Heterocypris incongruens (Ostracoda), and on the interaction between them. When reared in the absence of predators, C. diaphanus survival was low at the highest temperature (25 {$^\circ$}C) and greatly reduced at the lowest temperature (5 {$^\circ$}C). It was reproductively most successful at an intermediate temperature (20 {$^\circ$}C), suggesting that it may benefit from the increase in temperature predicted under future climate change scenarios. In the absence of other species, temperature would have to increase dramatically to affect C. diaphanus adversely. Heterocypris incongruens was more abundant and its predation on C. diaphanus greatest at higher temperatures, partially offsetting the positive effect of raised temperature on prey observed when the predator was absent. The net effect was that the optimal temperature for C. diaphanus when coexisting with its predator was lower than when it was in isolation. This means that currently predicted increases in temperature ultimately may be detrimental to C. diaphanus. Predation rates were generally enhanced by high temperature, prey size and prey density, with significant interaction between them. Thus, the positive effects of raised temperature on predation rate were additionally dependent upon prey characteristics, being strongest when prey were large and at high density and weakest when prey were small and at low density. Interactions with a natural enemy, in this case a predator, may alter how species respond to raised temperatures; prey size and density further modify the outcome of this interaction. This context dependency in the response of both predators and prey to temperature suggests that the ecological impacts of future climate change on trophic interactions may be difficult to predict.},

In 2000--2001, we monitored 141 Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) nests in the extensively forested Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia to assess the site's potential to host ``source'' populations of this common species. Our estimates of reproductive success, unlike most studies, incorporated the nesting behavior of marked females followed throughout the breeding season. Despite the presence of Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) in a nearby 15-y-old clearcut and in open areas of a summer camp, we found no parasitized nests. Overall, the predation rate was 41\%, 2.5 fledglings were produced per successful nesting attempt, and seasonal fecundity approached two female fledglings per adult female per season. Given return rates (minimum survival rates) of 52\% at our study site, our measured levels of reproductive success are sufficient to classify the Blue Ridge Mountains as a potential ``source'' for Acadian Flycatchers. Our data contrast sharply with those collected from landscapes with high levels of forest fragmentation in the midwestern and southeastern U.S., where even relatively large patches of forest appear to host ``sink'' populations of Acadian Flycatchers.},

However, few studies have examined acclimation responses in the context of the organism's ecology: namely, considering interactions among different species. In this study, we investigated the acclimation responses of three species of aquatic organisms from the same environment that simultaneously interact across different seasons. We predicted that the crimson spotted rainbowfish (Melanotaenia duboulayi) and the freshwater shrimp (Paratya australiensis), which are involved in a predator--prey relationship, would exhibit similar thermal acclimation responses due to an arms race in physiological responses. In contrast, we expected that the backswimmer (Enithares sp.) species from the same environment, which is not commonly preyed upon due to their hard chitinous exterior, would display a limited acclimation response. We found that acute increases in temperature resulted in improved locomotor performance for all three species and an improved prey capture performance for M. duboulayi. Acclimation to 15{$^\circ$}C or 25{$^\circ$}C for 6 weeks did not affect the prey-capture performance of M. duboulayi or the locomotor performance of either M. duboulayi or Enithares sp. However, acclimation to cool temperatures improved the locomotor performance of P. australiensis at both cool and warm temperatures. Thus, the interaction between M. duboulayi (predator) and P. australiensis (prey) is likely to change across seasons via differences in acclimation responses, which could directly affect their behavioural strategies and population dynamics.},

Increasing temperature (17--21--25~{$^\circ$}C) resulted in a reduction in predation rates (by Hypoplectrodes maccullochi, family Serranidae) on the tropical prey species (Abudefduf vaigiensis, family Pomacentridae) which were more warm adapted, whereas predation rates on the temperate prey species (Atypichthys strigatus, family Kyphosidae) remained unchanged over the 17--21~{$^\circ$}C range (25~{$^\circ$}C not tested). These changes were linearly related to predator--prey burst swimming ratios, which decreased with increasing temperature for the tropical prey but remained largely unchanged for the temperate prey. By demonstrating the temperature sensitivity of predator--prey interactions, our work highlights the importance of linking physiology with ecology to understand the consequences of climate-driven range shifts and species introductions.},

These species are typically tended by ants. In contrast, C. tremulae honeydew contained low proportions of melezitose. This species is typically untended. 3 Chaitophorus populeti and C. populialbae produced higher proportions of melezitose when reared on Populus tremula than on P. alba. 4 Chaitophorus populeti and C. populialbae reduced their production of melezitose when reared in the absence of ants. The reverse was true in C. tremulae. 5 These results show that honeydew composition differs not only between aphid species but also within aphid species. They support known differences in ant preference for the different aphid species, and produce further predictions for ant preference for aphids on different host plants. In particular they show for the first time that ant tending may itself influence honeydew composition. They suggest that maintaining a honeydew composition attractive to ants may incur metabolic costs on aphids.},

  author = {Flaxman, Michael and Lindsay, Kathryn},
  year = {2003},
  month = jan,
  abstract = {Habitat identification and mapping were performed for three forest-dwelling Neotropical migrant birds in southern Ontario all of which are species of concern in Canada: the Acadian Flycatcher (listed as endangered), the Hooded Warbler (threatened) and the Prothonotary Warbler (endangered). The study area encompasses 403,000km2 (40.3M ha) and is dominated by cropland (78.1\%) with 13.1\% forest cover and 14.4\% wooded and wetland cover combined. Habitat mapping for each species was based on three sources of information: nest site locations and other documented field observations, existing geographic information systems data layers, and habitat relationships reported in the scientific literature. Two data environmental data layers and their derivatives proved particularly critical: a satellite-based land cover classification, and a terrain elevation model. Analyses of known occurrence data suggests that all three species are area-sensitive. General landscape pattern metrics such as forested patch size and species-specific cost-distance measures based on land cover appear to be the most powerful predictors available of potential habitat for these species. For the Acadian Flycatcher, a cartographic model was created based on forest cover type, patch size, distance from patch edge, proximity to flood-prone wooded wetlands, and terrain elevation. This model correctly predicts 87\% of known observations, with 39\% apparent error of commission (predicted present but actually absent). The Hooded Warbler model was based on overall forest cover type, patch size, and terrain elevation. Only one nest was found in a patch smaller than 25ha, two thirds of observations were in patches of larger than 1000ha, and 96\% in patches larger than 100ha. The resulting model predicted 72\% of known occurrences with a 51\% apparent error of commission. Occurrences of the Prothonotary Warbler are clustered in three habitat complexes separated by large distances and spanning nearly 500km east/west. More than 95\% of nests were found in forested patches greater than 100ha in size. All known nests were found in areas of less than 4\% slope (98\% in areas of less than 1\% slope), and all nests were below 220m of elevation. A cartographic overlay model based on these factors and cost-distance to wooded wetland edge was able to explain 87\% of known occurrences (with a 61\% apparent error of commission). Based on tests with pseudo-absence data, all three models have relatively high apparent errors of commission. However, without independent in-field habitat estimates, it is not known if this represents a true error of commission or suitable but unoccupied habitat. For these three Carolinian species, habitat quantity does not appear to be a limiting factor, at least at the level which can be assessed using existing GIS data. If so, delineation of critical habitat will require judging which areas are most important and focusing conservation and management efforts in those locations. As one indication of socio-economic considerations for designation decisions, we examined the geographical distribution of habitat for all three species combined. Because we lack GIS information on current protected status, it is unclear how much of this potential habitat is already protected. We also tabulated it by municipality; Norfolk County is one municipality where potential socioeconomic effects might be concentrated if critical habitat were designated in a uniform distribution relative to habitat. Though important, at present we lack the data layers needed to classify habitat by land value or risk of development for a more comprehensive analysis of socio-economic factors relevant to critical habitat delineation. Potential habitat can be defined at multiple scales, by several methods, and with various error sensitivities. The overall challenge is to identify likely habitat based on available geographic information systems (GIS) data, and with limited areas of concentrated field sampling. While the basic process used is relatively straightforward, in practice there are several common limitations including no, poor or unavailable digital data layers. In addition, habitat suitability models can vary tremendously based on decisions taken about the appropriate balance of errors of commission versus omission. Because the purpose of the model is conservation of species at risk, this is basically a policy decision, and not a statistical one. For critical habitat delineation, Recovery teams need easy access to suitable mapping data; a challenge at the present time. In addition to species-specific data, in our experience, the following data layers are almost always required: recent land cover from satellite or airphoto mapping, forest resource inventories, terrain data, roads, hydrology, soils, and land tenure. A next step in this process is to couple the habitat and demographic simulation data now available for these three species in an appropriate forum to explore options for delineating critical habitat for species at risk in Carolinian Canada.},

Roadkills are a premier mortality source, yet except for local spots, rates rarely limit population size. Road avoidance, especially due to traffic noise, has a greater ecological impact. The still-more-important barrier effect subdivides populations, with demographic and probably genetic consequences. Road networks crossing landscapes cause local hydrologic and erosion effects, whereas stream networks and distant valleys receive major peak-flow and sediment impacts. Chemical effects mainly occur near roads. Road networks interrupt horizontal ecological flows, alter landscape spatial pattern, and therefore inhibit important interior species. Thus, road density and network structure are informative landscape ecology assays. Australia has huge road-reserve networks of native vegetation, whereas the Dutch have tunnels and overpasses perforating road barriers to enhance ecological flows. Based on road-effect zones, an estimated 15--20\% of the United States is ecologically impacted by roads.},

Mean intermolt periods for E. pacifica and M. norvegica were inversely and linearly related to temperature, over temperature ranges which the euphausiids normally encounter in the sea. At higher temperatures there was a tendency for three size groups of M. norvegica to approach a minimum intermolt period independent of temperature. M. norvegica cycled for different time periods between 13{$^\circ$} and 18{$^\circ$}C molted regularly at mean frequencies which would be expected if the animals had been held constantly at the timeweighted means of the two experimental temperatures. The increase in mean intermolt period per unit weight was faster in small, fast-growing M. norvegica than in large, slow-growing adults. This relationship was corroborated by following the changes in the intermolt period of an actively growing individual N. couchii over an 11 month period. Neither feeding nor the time of year of collection affected the molting frequency as long as temperature and animal weight were held constant. No tendency was found for euphausiids of the same species and/or size, and from the same collection, to molt on the same night. Molting occurred at night 80 to 90\% of the time for all species, over the temperature ranges normally experienced by the euphausiids in the sea, and over all animal weights tested. There appeared to be a weakening of the night-time molting rhythm at low temperatures. Although neither temperature nor an{\'i}mal weight substantially affected the night-time molting rhythm, both affected the mean intermolt period. Therefore, both temperature and body size apparently act together to adjust the length of the intermolt period of each individual in increments of whole days, but they exert little control over time of molting within any 24h period. No information was obtained regarding the factors which specify night-time molting over daytime molting within any 24 h period; however, regulation of certain hormone activities is probably involved.},

There is growing awareness that biotic interactions play an important role in generating range limits. However, current theory and data overwhelmingly focus on abiotic drivers and antagonistic interactions. Here we explore the effect that mutualists have on their partner's range limits: the geographic ``footprint'' of mutualism. This footprint arises from two general processes: modification of a partner's niche through environment-dependent fitness effects and, for a subset of mutualisms, dispersal opportunities that lead suitable habitats to be filled. We developed a conceptual framework that organizes different footprints of mutualism and the underlying mechanisms that shape them, and evaluated supporting empirical evidence from the primary literature. In the available literature, we found that the fitness benefits and dispersal opportunities provided by mutualism can extend species' ranges; conversely, the absence of mutualism can constrain species from otherwise suitable regions of their range. Most studies found that the footprint of mutualism is driven by changes in the frequency of mutualist partners from range core to range edge, whereas fewer found changes in interaction outcomes, the diversity of partners, or varying sensitivities of fitness to the effects of mutualists. We discuss these findings with respect to specialization, dependence, and intimacy of mutualism. Much remains unknown about the geographic footprint of mutualisms, leaving fruitful areas for future work. A particularly important future direction is to explore the role of mutualism during range shifts under global change, including the promotion of shifts at leading edges and persistence at trailing edges.},

Density dependence generated by interspecific competition should magnify sensitivity to changes in r. 3 We tested these predictions by assembling protist communities in laboratory microcosms and subjecting the communities to directional environmental change. Two experiments used pairs of competing protists (Colpidium striatum Stein and Tetrahymena thermophila Nanney \& McCoy, and Paramecium tetraurelia Sonneborn and Blepharisma americanum Suzuki) along with single-species controls. Two experiments used predator--prey pairs (Didinium nasutum M{\"u}ller or Euplotes patella Ehrenberg preying on Colpidium) and controls containing only prey. We grew replicates of each species combination in two temperature regimes (constant or slowly increasing temperature). Independent of these experiments, we quantified the temperature dependence of r (intrinsic rate of increase) for each species. 4 Comparison of effects of temperature on r to effects on mean density revealed that intraspecific competition buffered species densities against temperature changes that increased r by over 200\%. Interspecific interactions did not affect species responses to environmental change. Temperature change had weak effects on species densities, whether or not other species were present. 5 The results suggest that natural populations, regulated by direct density dependence, may be buffered against directional environmental change. Environmental change will have large effects when populations experience little density dependence, and when environmental change has different effects on the vital rates of different species.},

  abstract = {1 The ecological footprint of a road may extend for several kilometres with overlapping effects from neighbouring roads causing a nonlinear accumulation of road effects in the landscape. Availability of preferred habitat, spatial dependencies between roads and habitat types, and fidelity to traditionally used areas further confound our ability to predict population-level responses of animals to growing road networks. 2 To isolate these effects, we developed an individually based movement model using elk Cervus elaphus L. as a model system. Empirically derived movement rules redistributed elk under different amounts of preferred habitat (clearcuts), road densities, and road development schemes. We tracked potential mortality risk (given time spent near roads) and emigration rates (given declining accessibility of foraging habitat). 3 Design of the road network accounted for up to 30--55\% difference in mortality risk and emigration rates, with the largest differences occurring at intermediate road densities (1--1{$\cdot$}5 km km-2) when road effects began to saturate the landscape. Maintaining roads in association with clearcuts caused a decline in habitat accessibility equivalent to replacing 50--75\% of these foraging patches with conifer forest. A nine-fold difference in potential emigration was observed after varying elk tolerance for declining habitat accessibility despite holding local movement biases constant. 4 Elk responses to growing road networks were non-linear, exposing thresholds for road density that were reflected in the home range occupancy patterns of a large sample of elk in the region. 5 Synthesis and applications. Our approach provides a means of scaling-up complex movement decisions to population-level redistribution, separating the confounding effects of landscape context from road effects, and exposing thresholds in connectivity and mortality risks for wildlife caused by infrastructure growth. Our model indicated that road densities {$\leq$} 0{$\cdot$}5 km km-2 yielded the highest probability of elk occurrence where elk were hunted (and sensitive to roads), but disassociating roads from foraging habitats or managing human access to roads may maintain effective elk habitat at substantially higher road densities.},

  abstract = {Predicted climate change implies warmer weather and a higher frequency of extreme weather situations. The consequences of the warm July in 2003 was investigated in contrast to the cold July in 2004 in southern Sweden with focus on the dispersal rate of two species of burnet moths (Zygaenidae). During an extensive mark-release-recapture program in metapopulations of burnet moths substantial differences in inter habitat patch dispersal rates were observed. For two species of Zygaena it was 2.14 and 2.18 times higher during the warm year. Measured patch dispersal rate significantly declined towards the edges of the large study-area, suggesting that individuals disperse outside the study-area. No significant differences in dispersal rates were found between the two species studied. The dispersal rates were similar for both females and males, and no density dependent effects on dispersal or effects of amount of nectar rich flowers were found. Dispersal events appeared as distinct movements, often reaching several kilometres. We conclude that dispersal depend on climatic conditions. Exceptionally warm years may be especially important for survival of certain species in metapopulation systems and this may be crucial for the survival of populations during scenarios of climate change.},

Across the two groups, we found 64\% of surveyed researchers reported they had at least once failed to report results because they were not statistically significant (cherry picking); 42\% had collected more data after inspecting whether results were statistically significant (a form of p hacking) and 51\% had reported an unexpected finding as though it had been hypothesised from the start (HARKing). Such practices have been directly implicated in the low rates of reproducible results uncovered by recent large scale replication studies in psychology and other disciplines. The rates of QRPs found in this study are comparable with the rates seen in psychology, indicating that the reproducibility problems discovered in psychology are also likely to be present in ecology and evolution.},

  abstract = {Diverse biochemical and physiological adaptations enable different species of ectotherms to survive and reproduce in very different temperature regimes, but whether these adaptations fully compensate for the thermodynamically depressing effects of low temperature on rates of biological processes is debated. If such adaptations are fully compensatory, then temperature-dependent processes (e.g., digestion rate, population growth rate) of cold-adapted species will match those of warm-adapted species when each is measured at its own optimal temperature. Here we show that cold-adapted insect species have much lower maximum rates of population growth than do warm-adapted species, even when we control for phylogenetic relatedness. This pattern also holds when we use a structural-equation model to analyze alternative hypotheses that might otherwise explain this correlation. Thus, although physiological adaptations enable some insects to survive and reproduce at low temperatures, these adaptations do not overcome the ``tyranny'' of thermodynamics, at least for rates of population increase. Indeed, the sensitivity of population growth rates of insects to temperature is even greater than predicted by a recent thermodynamic model. Our findings suggest that adaptation to temperature inevitably alters the population dynamics of insects. This result has broad evolutionary and ecological consequences.},

The costs and benefits of mutualism often depend on the abiotic or biotic context in which an interaction occurs, and experimental manipulations can induce shifts in interaction outcomes from mutualism all the way to parasitism. Yet, research suggests that mutualisms rarely turn parasitic in nature. Similarly, despite the potential for `cheating' to undermine mutualism evolution, empirical evidence for fitness conflicts between partners and, thus, selection for cheating in mutualisms is scant. Furthermore, mutualism seldom leads to parasitism at macroevolutionary timescales. Thus, I argue here that mutualisms do not deserve their reputation for ecological and evolutionary instability, and are not on the verge of breakdown.},

Here, we analyze Orthoptera assemblage shifts between 1996 and 2017 across three grassland types in the Black Forest (SW Germany) (N~=~63): (i) formerly managed wet grasslands which have been frequently abandoned in recent decades (WET) (N~=~15); (ii) common pastures which are still traditionally managed by rough grazing (COMMON) (N~=~29), and (iii) mesic grasslands which have recently suffered from land-use intensification (MESIC) (N~=~19). Both annual and summer temperatures increased during the study period. Orthoptera assemblages strongly responded to the altered environmental conditions in the grasslands. However, effects differed clearly among grassland types. Despite a strong increase in overall species richness in common pastures, neither the Community Farmland Index (CFI) nor the Community Temperature Index (CTI) had changed. In the two other grassland types, the CFI decreased and the CTI increased. The CFI -- established here for Orthoptera -- helped to disentangle the effects of climate and land-use change on Orthoptera assemblage composition. Based on our study, climate warming has led to biotic homogenization of the Orthoptera assemblages of wet grasslands affected by abandonment, and mesic grasslands affected by land-use intensification towards a dominance of more widespread species. In contrast, common pastures characterized by a high heterogeneity and low-intensity management were more resilient to the effects of climate warming.},

  abstract = {The rate at which genomes adapt to environmental changes and the prevalence of adaptive processes in molecular evolution are two controversial issues in current evolutionary genetics. Previous attempts to quantify the genome-wide rate of adaptation through amino-acid substitution have revealed a surprising diversity of patterns, with some species (e.g. Drosophila) experiencing a very high adaptive rate, while other (e.g. humans) are dominated by nearly-neutral processes. It has been suggested that this discrepancy reflects between-species differences in effective population size. Published studies, however, were mainly focused on model organisms, and relied on disparate data sets and methodologies, so that an overview of the prevalence of adaptive protein evolution in nature is currently lacking. Here we extend existing estimators of the amino-acid adaptive rate by explicitly modelling the effect of favourable mutations on non-synonymous polymorphism patterns, and we apply these methods to a newly-built, homogeneous data set of 44 non-model animal species pairs. Data analysis uncovers a major contribution of adaptive evolution to the amino-acid substitution process across all major metazoan phyla---with the notable exception of humans and primates. The proportion of adaptive amino-acid substitution is found to be positively correlated to species effective population size. This relationship, however, appears to be primarily driven by a decreased rate of nearly-neutral amino-acid substitution because of more efficient purifying selection in large populations. Our results reveal that adaptive processes dominate the evolution of proteins in most animal species, but do not corroborate the hypothesis that adaptive substitutions accumulate at a faster rate in large populations. Implications regarding the factors influencing the rate of adaptive evolution and positive selection detection in humans vs. other organisms are discussed.},

Most analyzed spots led to successful protein identifications, demonstrating that Brassica napus, a close relative of Arabidopsis thaliana, is a highly suitable model plant for phloem research. None of the identified proteins was formerly known to be present in Brassica napus phloem, but several proteins have been described in phloem sap of other species. The data, which is discussed with respect to possible physiological importance of the proteins in the phloem, further confirms and substantially extends earlier findings and uncovers the presence of new protein functions in the vascular system. For example, we found several formerly unknown phloem proteins that are potentially involved in signal generation and transport, e.g., proteins mediating calcium and G-protein signaling, a set of RNA-binding proteins, and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and its twin sister that might be key components for the regulation of flowering time.},

For central and western Massachusetts, we estimated that salamanders would be exposed to at least this threshold level of risk at 22--73\% of populations (assuming a 100 vs. 500~m migration distance, respectively). We conclude that road mortality can be a significant source of additive mortality for individual spotted salamanders in many parts of the species' range.

The Red Queen hypothesis proposes that parasite-mediated selection against common host genotypes could counteract the per capita birth rate advantage of asexuals. Under the Red Queen hypothesis, fluctuations in parasite-mediated selection can drive fluctuations in the asexual population, leading to the coexistence of sexual and asexual reproduction. Does shifting selection by parasites drive fluctuations in the fitness and frequency of asexuals in nature? Combining long-term field data with mesocosm experiments, we detected a shift in the direction of parasite selection in the snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum and its coevolving parasite, Microphallus sp. In the early 2000s, asexuals were more infected than sexuals. A decade later, the asexuals had declined in frequency and were less infected than sexuals. Over time, the mean infection prevalence of asexuals equaled that of sexuals but varied far more. This variation in asexual infection prevalence suggests the potential for parasite-mediated fluctuations in asexual fitness. Accordingly, we detected fitness consequences of the shift in parasite selection: when they were less infected than sexuals, asexuals increased in frequency in the field and in paired mesocosms that isolated the effect of parasites. The match between field and experiment argues that coevolving parasites drive temporal change in the relative fitness and frequency of asexuals, potentially promoting the coexistence of reproductive modes in P. antipodarum.},

Most of this new work has centred on changes in the regulatory components of the genome. However, recent studies (many of them documented in this volume) have shown that development also includes interactions between the organism and its environment. One area of interest concerns the importance of symbionts for the production of the normal range of phenotypes. Many, if not most, organisms have 'outsourced' some of their developmental signals to a set of symbionts that are expected to be acquired during development. Such intimate interactions between species are referred to as codevelopment, the production of a new individual through the coordinated interactions of several genotypically different species. Within the past 2 years, several research programmes have demonstrated that such codevelopmental schemes can be selected. We will focus on symbioses in coral reef cnidarians symbiosis, pea aphids and cactuses, wherein the symbiotic system provides thermotolerance for the composite organism.},

We measured both the energetic metabolism and behaviour of greater mouse-eared bats submitted to three different parasite loads (no, 20 and 40 mites) during whole daily cycles. Mites greatly affected their time and energy budgets. They caused increased grooming activity, reduced the overall time devoted to resting and provoked a dramatic shortening of resting bout duration. Correspondingly, the bats' overall metabolism (oxygen consumption) increased drastically with parasite intensity and, during the course of experiments, the bats lost more weight when infested with 40 rather than 20 or no parasites. The short-term energetic constraints induced by anti-parasite grooming are probably associated with long-term detrimental effects such as a decrease in survival and overall reproductive value.},

  abstract = {Grooming is an important behaviour for the control of ectoparasites in mammals but it is also energetically costly. Therefore, the time an animal allocates to grooming may be used to evaluate the potential cost of an ectoparasite to its host. Most mammals are host to more than one ectoparasite species, which may impose different costs. We experimentally evaluated the relative cost of three ectoparasite species by observing the grooming response of their host, Gould's wattled bat (Chalinolobus gouldii), to the manipulation of parasite load. The parasite that spent its entire lifecycle on the host, the mite Spinturnix novaehollandiae, triggered the greatest increase in grooming. A grooming response was not as evident for the other parasites (a smaller mite, Trichonyssus womersleyi, and a bat fly, Basilia troughtoni), possibly because part of their lifecycle occurred in the roost, which the host may avoid by discriminative roost selection. Grooming behaviour, although not significantly altered by parasites other than S. novaehollandiae, was performed by most bats, which maintained a baseline grooming rate even when relatively parasite free. This study suggests heterogeneity in the costs imparted on a host by members of its ectoparasite community and the potential importance of considering parasite life-history when evaluating the influence of parasites on the host.},

  abstract = {Aim Collisions between wildlife and vehicles are recognized as one of the major causes of mortality for many species. Empirical estimates of road mortality show that some species are more likely to be killed than others, but to what extent this variation can be explained and predicted using intrinsic species characteristics remains poorly understood. This study aims to identify general macroecological patterns associated with road mortality and generate spatial and species-level predictions of risks. Location Brazil. Time period 2001--2014. Major taxa Birds and mammals. Methods We fitted trait-based random forest regression models (controlling for survey characteristics) to explain 783 empirical road mortality rates from Brazil, representing 170 bird and 73 mammalian species. Fitted models were then used to make spatial and species-level predictions of road mortality risk in Brazil, considering 1,775 birds and 623 mammals that occur within the continental boundaries of the country. Results Survey frequency and geographical location were key predictors of observed rates, but mortality was also explained by the body size, reproductive speed and ecological specialization of the species. Spatial predictions revealed a high potential standardized (per kilometre of road) mortality risk in Amazonia for birds and mammals and, additionally, a high risk in Southern Brazil for mammals. Given the existing road network, these predictions mean that {$>$}8 million birds and {$>$}2 million mammals could be killed per year on Brazilian roads. Furthermore, predicted rates for all Brazilian endotherms uncovered potential vulnerability to road mortality of several understudied species that are currently listed as threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Conclusion With a rapidly expanding global road network, there is an urgent need to develop improved approaches to assess and predict road-related impacts. This study illustrates the potential of trait-based models as assessment tools to gain a better understanding of the correlates of vulnerability to road mortality across species, and as predictive tools for difficult-to-sample or understudied species and areas.},

We investigated possible fitness costs of hyperparasitism as influenced by host size. Our study was conducted with the facultative hyperparasitoid Pachycrepoideus dubius Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), which parasitizes host species differing greatly in size. We compared some fitness traits (level of successful parasitism, development time, sex ratio and offspring size) of P. dubius developing on large secondary/primary (Delia radicum L. (Diptera: Anthomyiidae)/Trybliographa rapae Westwood (Hymenoptera: Figitidae)) or small secondary/primary host species (Drosophila melanogaster L./Asobara tabida Nees (Hymenoptera: Braconidae)). In no-choice and choice experiments, P. dubius was able to develop on different stages of T. rapae (L2 (endophagous), L4 (ectophagous), and pupae) but that it preferred to parasitize unparasitized D. radicum pupae over pupae parasitized by T. rapae. Furthermore, in P. dubius, hyperparasitism was associated with fitness costs (lower level of successful parasitism, smaller adult size) and these costs were greater on the smallest host complex. We hypothesize that the size of D. melanogaster pupae parasitized by A. tabida may be close to the suboptimal host size for P. dubius beneath which the costs of hyperparasitism make this strategy nonadaptive. Hyperparasitism in terms of trade-offs between host quality and abundance of competitors is discussed.},

Lentic species are thought to have a higher dispersal propensity than lotic species because of the lower spatial and temporal persistence of lentic habitats on average. Hence, we expected shifts in the range boundaries particularly of lentic species. Location Europe. Methods Our analyses are based on odonate distribution maps from two field guides that present the European ranges of dragonflies and damselflies in 1988 and 2006. We categorized species according to their preference for lentic or lotic habitats, and then assigned each species to a southern or a northern group according to the centre of its distribution. Shifts in northern range boundaries were calculated as the average distance between the 10 northernmost grid cells in 1988 and 2006. Range boundary shifts were also analysed with regard to prevalence, phenology, body size and wing size. Results Lentic species of the southern group expanded their range boundaries on average 115 km northwards per decade, whereas lotic species of the southern group on average did not change their range boundaries. Northern lentic and lotic species showed no consistent trends in their changes in range boundaries. These results did not qualitatively change when we considered the effects of phylogeny, phenology, body size and wing size. Main conclusions Our results support the hypothesis that species adapted to lentic habitats, which are assumed to be less persistent in time and space, disperse better than lotic species.},

We tested the hypothesis that interspecific difference in the capacity for thermal acclimation modulates predator--prey interactions. Acclimation of locomotor performance in a predator (Australian bass, Macquaria novemaculeata) was qualitatively different to that of its prey (eastern mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki). Warm (25{$^\circ$}C) acclimated bass made more attacks than cold (15{$^\circ$}C) acclimated fish regardless of acute test temperatures (10--30{$^\circ$}C), and greater frequency of attacks was associated with increased prey capture success. However, the number of attacks declined at the highest test temperature (30{$^\circ$}C). Interestingly, escape speeds of mosquitofish during predation trials were greater than burst speeds measured in a swimming arena, whereas attack speeds of bass were lower than burst speeds. As a result, escape speeds of mosquitofish were greater at warm temperatures (25{$^\circ$}C and 30{$^\circ$}C) than attack speeds of bass. The decline in the number of attacks and the increase in escape speed of prey means that predation pressure decreases at high temperatures. We show that differential thermal responses affect species interactions even at temperatures that are within thermal tolerance ranges. This thermal sensitivity of predator--prey interactions can be a mechanism by which global warming affects ecological communities.},

  abstract = {In the wing dimorphic milkweed-oleander aphid,Aphis nerii, winged aphids begin reproducing about 1.5 days after wingless aphids. The longer maturation period is primarily due to slower development since even adult eclosion by winged aphids takes place after wingless aphids begin reproducing. The delay is not due to a post-eclosion, pre-reproductive flight since, beginning with the fourth instar, larval winged aphids were reared at a density of one per plant and the vast majority were not stimulated to fly under such low-density conditions. Thus, the ability to fly incurs a fitness cost in terms of delayed reproduction, irrespective of whether flight actually occurs. We did not observe a difference between morphs for lifetime fecundity, even though wingless aphids have larger abdomens than winged aphids and for both morphs there is a significant correlation between abdomen width and fecundity. Offspring produced by wingless aphids over the first four days of reproduction are larger than those produced by winged aphids, and the size difference at birth is maintained into adulthood. However, there are no differences in life history traits between these offspring, including maturation period and lifetime fecundity. Thus, reduced body size does not increase the cost of being able to fly, at least under the conditions of these experiments. The cost of being able to fly in this species should favor reduced production of winged individuals in populations that exploit more permanent host plants.},

I compared populations for migratory potential, measured as the proportion of winged offspring produced in response to being crowded, and for life history and morphometric traits of the subsequent adult winged aphids. I predicted a negative correlation between degree of host plant permanence and migratory potential. As predicted, aphids from Iowa, where migration on to temporary hosts must occur each year, produce a greater proportion of winged offspring (37.7\%) than those from California (25.7\%) or Puerto Rico (31.6\%) where hosts are more permanent. However, hosts in Puerto Rico appear to be more permanent than those in California, yet the difference between populations for migratory potential was opposite to that predicted. Within California the prediction again held: aphids collected from the most impermanent sites produce the greatest proportion of winged offspring. There were no population differences for any life history or morphometric traits of winged aphids that are important contributors to fitness or migratory ability such as time to reproductive maturity, fecundity or wing length. Nor did any traits covary with migratory potential. Thus, there does not appear to be an association of life history and morphology with migratory potential that could enhance the colonizing ability of migrant aphids. I was unable to detect population differentiation for life history and morphology even though there is ample genetic variation within populations on which selection could act and an absence of constraints arising from genetic correlations that could prevent appropriate evolution of traits within populations. The exploitation of temporary host plants therefore occurs by an increase in the number of colonists produced and not by change in life history or morphology of those colonists.},

With data from hundreds of species spanning 20 genera in 15 families, we show that plant species that autonomously reproduce via self-pollination consistently have larger geographic ranges than their close relatives that generally require two parents for reproduction. Further analyses strongly implicate autonomous self-fertilisation in causing this relationship, as it is not driven by traits such as polyploidy or annual life history whose evolution is sometimes correlated with selfing. Furthermore, we find that selfers occur at higher maximum latitudes and that disparity in range size between selfers and outcrossers increases with time since their evolutionary divergence. Together, these results show that autonomous reproduction---a critical biological trait that eliminates mate limitation and thus potentially increases the probability of establishment---increases range size.},

  abstract = {A life-history trade-off exists between flight capability and reproduction in many wing dimorphic insects: a long-winged morph is flight-capable at the expense of reproduction, while a short-winged morph cannot fly, is less mobile, but has greater reproductive output. Using meta-analyses, I investigated specific questions regarding this trade-off. The trade-off in females was expressed primarily as a later onset of egg production and lower fecundity in long-winged females relative to short-winged females. Although considerably less work has been done with males, the trade-off exists for males among traits primarily related to mate acquisition. The trade-off can potentially be mitigated in males, as long-winged individuals possess an advantage in traits that can offset the costs of flight capability such as a shorter development time. The strength and direction of trends differed significantly among insect orders, and there was a relationship between the strength and direction of trends with the relative flight capabilities between the morphs. I discuss how the trade-off might be both under- and overestimated in the literature, especially in light of work that has examined two relevant aspects of wing dimorphic species: (1) the effect of flight-muscle histolysis on reproductive investment; and (2) the performance of actual flight by flight-capable individuals.},

  abstract = {Aphids are frequently engaged in mutualistic associations with endosymbionts. Symbionts are bacterial or fungal microorganisms that can be obligate or facultative to aphids. Research showed facultative (or secondary) symbionts have numerous effects on their host aphids such as resistance to heat shock, parasitoids and fungus etc., which may consequently promote a co-evolution between symbionts and hosts. However, this symbiotic relation may be affected by several factors, such as the ability of symbionts to spread from aphids to others within and across populations, and the cost of infections for hosts. Moreover, aphid-symbionts interactions may be affected by aphid living environment such as its host plant, the presence of natural enemies or the temperature. Here we firstly described the functions of nine facultative symbionts (Serratia symbiotica, Hamiltonella defensa, Regiella insecticola, Rickettsia, Rickettsiella, PAXS (pea aphid X-type symbiont), Spiroplasma, Wolbachia and Arsenophonus) studied in aphids one by one, and discussed the associations between these symbionts and aphids, plants and environment. We aim to have a better knowledge of the roles the facultative symbionts play in aphid biology, ecology and evolution, which we believe can provide new inspirations for aphid control.},

Almost all studies on this topic have been observational, and thus have not been able to separate the effects of individual quality, habitat selection and predation risk of given nest sites from each other. More experimental studies on nest predation and breeding dispersal, therefore, are needed to avoid confusing interpretations of the results. In western Finland, pine marten (Martes martes) predation risk was experimentally simulated at the nests of Tengmalm's owls (Aegolius funereus) by using a caged American mink (Mustela vison) as a predator. Nests without exposure to a mink served as controls. In accordance with our predictions and earlier observational studies, males exposed to simulated predation risk increased nest-hole shift and breeding dispersal distances compared to control males. Nest-hole shift and long breeding dispersal distances probably decrease the risk of nest predation, because pine martens are known to revisit nest-holes they have found.},

We manipulate rainfall timing and relative densities of the grass Avena barbata and forb Erodium botrys, parameterise a demographic model, and partition coexistence mechanisms. Rainfall variability was integral to grass--forb coexistence. Variability enhanced growth rates of both species, and early-season drought was essential for Erodium persistence. While theoretical developments have focused on the storage effect, it was not critical for coexistence. In comparison, relative nonlinearity strongly stabilised coexistence, where Erodium experienced disproportionately high growth under early-season drought due to competitive release from Avena. Our results underscore the importance of environmental variability and suggest that relative nonlinearity is a critical if underappreciated coexistence mechanism.},

SBeA is validated to uncover previously overlooked social behaviour phenotypes of autism spectrum disorder knockout mice.

  abstract = {Abstract: To allow for long-term metapopulation persistence, a network of habitat fragments must satisfy a certain condition in terms of number, size, and spatial configuration of the fragments. The influence of landscape structure on the threshold condition can be measured by a quantity called metapopulation capacity, which can be calculated for real fragmented landscapes. Habitat loss and fragmentation reduce the metapopulation capacity of a landscape and make it less likely that the threshold condition can be met. If the condition is not met, the metapopulation is expected to go extinct, but it takes some time following habitat loss before the extinction will occur, which generates an extinction debt in a community of species. We show that extinction debt is especially great in a community in which many species are close to their extinction threshold following habitat loss because the metapopulation-dynamic time delay is especially long in such species. A corollary is that landscapes that have recently experienced substantial habitat loss and fragmentation are expected to show a transient excess of rare species, which represents a previously overlooked signature of extinction debt. We consider a putative example of extinction debt on forest-inhabiting beetles in Finland. At present, the few remaining natural-like forests are distributed evenly throughout southern Finland, but the number of regionally extinct old-growth forest beetles is much greater in the southwestern coastal areas, where human impact on forests has been lengthy, than in the northeastern inland areas, where intensive forestry started only after World War II. Ignoring time delays in population and metapopulation dynamics will lead to an underestimate of the number of effectively endangered species.},

Moreover, predation risk induces a size-structured depth separation, such that small individuals, which we show are less vulnerable to predation than larger, make a risk assessment and continue feeding in surface waters during day, offering a competitive release from down-migrating larger animals. Hence, we mechanistically show that such simple organisms as invertebrate zooplankton are able to make individual, size-specific decisions regarding how to compromise between threats from both predators and UV radiation, and adjust their diel migratory patterns accordingly.},

  abstract = {Video techniques have been used to study the flight behaviour of aphids over a number of years. Experimental approaches include: (1) two-dimensional analysis of flight responses to visual stimuli in a video-computer automated vertical wind tunnel; (2) three-dimensional analysis of flight tracks in horizontal wind tunnels and in the field; and (3) assessment of behaviour after landing and factors affecting the probability of subsequent take-off. Studies in the laboratory have concentrated on the host-alternating black bean aphid, Aphis fabae. Both crowd-induced long-day winged females (summer alate virginoparae) which fly to fresh summer hosts and short-day induced, winged autumn forms (gynoparae) have been investigated. Individual A. fabae can be flown for many hours in a vertical wind tunnel when changes in the rate of climb are countered by corresponding changes in downward air flow. Such control may be automated by coupling the video signal of the flying aphid, via a teletracker and through a computer, to servo control air flow. The computer is also used to effect the presentation of visual stimuli. The two-dimensional flight track of the insect can be saved to computer disc for later analysis and responses to visual stimuli presented during flight can be detailed. Studies have revealed major differences in initial flight behaviour between summer and autumn winged forms, as well as a maximum response to a visual target illuminated with green, monochromatic light at wavelengths of {$\approx$}550 nm. To obtain a more accurate analysis of flight, a technique was developed to examine three-dimensional aspects of aphid flight tracks. By superimposing the signals from two video cameras placed side-by-side with overlapping fields of view, two images of the insect appear on the monitor and the distance between them is proportional to the distance from the cameras. The xyz co-ordinates during flight can then be calculated at up to 50 Hz and flight track parameters computed. This technique was used with aphids flying in a horizontal wind tunnel in the laboratory and, when coupled to an ultrasonic anemometer, in the field. Studies show that aphids tend to control ground speed and to land into the wind. When young adult winged aphids, which have flown from their natal plant in culture cabinets, are placed on host or non-host plant material, they may stay and settle or fly off. The use of close-up video showed that gynoparae of A. fabae can discriminate between a summer host (broad bean, Vicia faba) and the winter, relevant host (spindle tree, Euonymus europaeus) within a 5-min period. On the unsuitable plant, 75\% initiate flight. Plant factors detected during brief stylet penetration of epidermal cells appear to be responsible for this discrimination.},

  abstract = {Dispersal ability will largely determine whether species track their climatic niches during climate change, a process especially important for populations at contracting (low-latitude/low-elevation) range limits that otherwise risk extinction. We investigate whether dispersal evolution at contracting range limits is facilitated by two processes that potentially enable edge populations to experience and adjust to the effects of climate deterioration before they cause extinction: (i) climate-induced fitness declines towards range limits and (ii) local adaptation to a shifting climate gradient. We simulate a species distributed continuously along a temperature gradient using a spatially explicit, individual-based model. We compare range-wide dispersal evolution during climate stability vs. directional climate change, with uniform fitness vs. fitness that declines towards range limits (RLs), and for a single climate genotype vs. multiple genotypes locally adapted to temperature. During climate stability, dispersal decreased towards RLs when fitness was uniform, but increased when fitness declined towards RLs, due to highly dispersive genotypes maintaining sink populations at RLs, increased kin selection in smaller populations, and an emergent fitness asymmetry that favoured dispersal in low-quality habitat. However, this initial dispersal advantage at low-fitness RLs did not facilitate climate tracking, as it was outweighed by an increased probability of extinction. Locally adapted genotypes benefited from staying close to their climate optima; this selected against dispersal under stable climates but for increased dispersal throughout shifting ranges, compared to cases without local adaptation. Dispersal increased at expanding RLs in most scenarios, but only increased at the range centre and contracting RLs given local adaptation to climate.},

  abstract = {Background The importance of genetic diversity in successful biological invasions is unclear. In animals, but not necessarily plants, increased genetic diversity is generally associated with successful colonization and establishment of novel habitats. The Oleander aphid, Aphis nerii, though native to the Mediterranean region, is an invasive pest species throughout much of the world. Feeding primarily on Oleander (Nerium oleander) and Milkweed (Asclepias spp.) under natural conditions, these plants are unlikely to support aphid populations year round in the southern US. The objective of this study was to describe the genetic variation within and among US populations of A. nerii, during extinction/recolonization events, to better understand the population ecology of this invasive species. Methodology/Principal Findings We used five microsatellite markers to assess genetic diversity over a two year period within and among three aphid populations separated by small (100 km) and large (3,700 km) geographic distances on two host plant species. Here we provide evidence for A. nerii ``superclones''. Genotypic variation was absent in all populations (i.e., each population consisted of a single multilocus genotype (MLG) or ``clone'') and the genetic composition of only one population completely changed across years. There was no evidence of sexual reproduction or host races on different plant species. Conclusions/Significance Aphis nerii is a well established invasive species despite having extremely low genetic diversity. As this aphid appears to be obligatorily asexual, it may share more similarities with clonally reproducing invasive plants, than with other animals. Patterns of temporal and geographic genetic variation, viewed in the context of its population dynamics, have important implications for the management of invasive pests and the evolutionary biology of asexual species.},

We used published data and rhizobial 16S rRNA sequences from GenBank to quantify the number of rhizobia partners that associate with 159 legume species, spanning the legume phylogeny and the globe.

Moreover, externally created simulations, e.g. posterior predictive simulations from Bayesian software such as 'JAGS', 'STAN', or 'BUGS' can be processed as well. The resulting residuals are standardized to values between 0 and 1 and can be interpreted as intuitively as residuals from a linear regression.

It resembles the Lotka-Volterra model in having linear zero growth isoclines, and thus, also in its general requirements for the coexistence of competing species. It differs in allowing the populations to show damped oscillations, stable cycles or even apparent ``chaos'' if competition is sufficiently severe. A similar two age-class model is discussed where there is both intra- and interspecific competition in one of the developmental stages, but only intraspecific competition in the other. Even this slight increase in complexity leads to markedly different properties. The zero growth curves become nonlinear and up to three equilibria between two competing species are possible.},

Here we investigate the effects of intra- and interspecific density-dependent dispersal on the regional stability in a predator--prey metacommunity model. We show that, when the dynamics of the populations reach equilibrium, the stability of the metacommunity is not affected by density-dependent dispersal. However, the regional stability, measured as the regional variability or the persistence, can be modified by density-dependent dispersal when local populations fluctuate over time. Moreover these effects depend on the relative dispersal of the predator and the prey. Regional stability is modified through changes in spatial synchrony. Interspecific density-dependent dispersal always desynchronizses local dynamics, whereas intraspecific density-dependent dispersal may either synchronize or desynchronize it depending on dispersal rates. Moreover, intra- and interspecific density-dependent dispersal strengthen the top-down control of the prey by the predator at intermediate dispersal rates. As a consequence the regional stability of the metacommunity is increased at intermediate dispersal rates. Our results show that density-dependent dispersal and relative dispersal of species are keys to understanding the response of ecosystems to fragmentation.},

  abstract = {Grooming behaviour plays various roles in the health care, reproduction, and social life of an individual vertebrate. However, the reasons for the variability in time spent grooming amongst species, populations and individuals are not fully understood. We tested the hypothesis that the main role of grooming is ectoparasite removal and thus that time spent grooming by an animal reflects the costs of parasite infestation offset against the costs of grooming. The test was conducted on a rodent, Meriones crassus, that is parasitised by a flea, Xenopsylla conformis. We monitored behaviour of juvenile and adult rodents before and after flea infestation and quantified the probability of mortality of fleas with respect to the time spent grooming in adults compared with juvenile rodents. We predicted that: (1) increased costs of flea infestation (e.g. in parasitised as opposed to flea-free rodents and in juveniles as opposed to adults) increases time spent grooming and (2) mortality probability per flea increases with increasing time spent grooming and is higher for fleas on juveniles than for fleas on adult rodents. We were interested to discover at the expense of which activity grooming is increased. Our findings established that the major role of grooming is in flea removal, as exposure to fleas evoked grooming activity in all rodents and grooming activity explained 57--70\% of the variation in flea mortality. Furthermore, we showed that the rise in grooming activity was at the expense of resting. However, we found only partial support for the predicted increase in grooming time with increasing costs of flea infestation. Flea infestation did indeed increase the time spent grooming by rodents. Nevertheless, juvenile rodents who incur higher costs of flea infestation spent less time grooming than adults and sustained similar flea densities, suggesting that these hosts are constrained by some other factors, such as feeding time.},

Eurythermal organisms maintain aerobic scope over wide ranges of temperatures, but it is unknown whether acclimation is necessary to maintain this breadth. The objective of this study was to examine changes in aerobic scope in Fundulus heteroclitus, a eurythermal fish, after acclimation and acute exposure to temperatures from 5{$^\circ$} to 33{$^\circ$}C. The range of temperatures over which aerobic scope was nonzero was similar in acclimated and acutely exposed fish, suggesting that acclimation has modest effects on the thermal breadth of aerobic scope. However, in acclimated fish, there was a clear optimum temperature range for aerobic scope between 25{$^\circ$} and 30{$^\circ$}C, whereas aerobic scope was relatively constant across the entire temperature range with acute temperature exposure. Therefore, the primary effect of acclimation was to increase aerobic scope between 25{$^\circ$} and 30{$^\circ$}C, which paradoxically resulted in a narrower temperature range of optimal performance in acclimated fish compared to acutely exposed fish. There was only weak evidence for correlations between the thermal optimum of aerobic scope and the thermal optimum of measures of performance (specific growth rate and gonadosomatic index), and indicators of anaerobic metabolism (lactate accumulation and lactate dehydrogenase activity) only increased at high temperatures. Together these data fit many, but not all, of the predictions made by OCLTT.},

Parasite assemblages may also provide powerful models to study general principles of ecological energetics. Yet there has been little ecological research on parasite-host energetics, probably due to methodological difficulties. However, the scaling relationships of individual metabolic rate with body or cell size and temperature may permit us to tackle the energetics of parasite assemblages in hosts. This article offers the foundations and initial testing of a metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) framework for parasites in hosts. I first provide equations to estimate energetic flux through observed parasite assemblages. I then develop metabolic scaling theory for parasite abundance, energetics, and biomass in individual hosts. In contrast to previous efforts, the theory factors in both host and parasite metabolic scaling, how parasites use host space, and whether energy or space dictates carrying capacity. Empirical tests indicate that host energetic flux can set parasite carrying capacity, which decreases as predicted considering the scaling of host and parasite metabolic rates. The theory and results also highlight that the phenomenon of ``energetic equivalence'' is not an assumption of MTE but a possible outcome contingent on how species partition resources. Hence, applying MTE to parasites can lend mechanistic, quantitative, predictive insight into the nature of parasitism and can inform general ecological theory.},

The interplay of these two processes, however, is a critically important yet unresolved issue. To fill this gap in our knowledge of ecosystem stability, we investigate dynamic random and niche model food webs to evaluate the proportion of persistent species. We show that stronger body-size structures and faster adaptation stabilise these food webs. Body-size structures yield stabilising configurations of interaction strength distributions across food webs, and adaptive foraging emphasises links to resources closer to the base. Moreover, both mechanisms combined have a cumulative effect. Most importantly, unstructured random webs evolve via adaptive foraging into stable size-structured food webs. This offers a mechanistic explanation of how size structure adaptively emerges in complex food webs, thus building a novel bridge between these two important stabilising mechanisms.},

Surrounding landscape was assessed using open access land cover classes for the region (Coordination of Information on the Environment, CORINE). Hotspot analysis was performed using kernel density estimation (KDE+).

Dung beetles, characterized by their use of decomposing organic material, provide a useful model for understanding the structuring of ecological communities and the role of competition based on their size and morphology. The relationship between body size and shape in a dung beetle community from the Atlantic Forest in Serra do Japi, Brazil was analyzed for 39 species. Fifteen anatomical landmarks on three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates were used to describe both the shape and the size of the body of each species on the basis of the centroid located along homologous points in all of the species. The first vector of a principal components analysis explained 38.5\% of the morphological variation among species, and represents a gradient of body shape from elongated, flattened bodies with narrow abdomen to rounded or convex bodies. The second component explained 17.8\% of the remaining variation in body shape, which goes from species with an abdomen that is larger than the elytra to species with constricted abdomens and large elytra. The relationship between body size and shape was analyzed separately for diurnal and nocturnal species. In both guilds not only were there differences in body size, but also in body shape, suggesting a reduction in their level of competition.},

We compared the responses of dogwood populations to the anthracnose in both the mixed mesophytic forest of the Cumberland Plateau coves and the oak-hickory forest of the plateau uplands. We surveyed dogwood populations in four randomly located 0.1-ha plots in each forest site, and we surveyed community composition in eight randomly located 0.05-ha plots in each study forest. This study is the first to document dogwood mortality due to anthrac-nose within the geophysiological province of the Cumberland Plateau. Factors affecting the rate of anthrac-nose spread (evaporative potential, soil moisture, and light levels) differed between the coves and uplands, but trends in the data suggest that dogwood may be eliminated from each of the forests we studied. Moreover, changes in plant community composition since introduction of the fungus show an increase in two bird-dispersed species---blackgum ( Nyssa sylvatica ) and spicebush ( Lindera benzoin )---concurrent with declining dogwood populations. Decomposition of dogwood litter plays an important role in calcium cycling in these forests, and, on the poorly buffered soils of the Cumberland Plateau, calcium retention could lead to a decline in passerine birds, that depend on calcium for their shells, through loss of invertebrate food sources. As the dogwood anthracnose epidemic continues and the largest size classes of dogwood disappear, additional changes in species composition and community dynamics are likely to occur in these forests.

  abstract = {Metapopulation extinction risk is the probability that all local populations are simultaneously extinct during a fixed time frame. Dispersal may reduce a metapopulation's extinction risk by raising its average per-capita growth rate. By contrast, dispersal may raise a metapopulation's extinction risk by reducing its average population density. Which effect prevails is controlled by habitat fragmentation. Dispersal in mildly fragmented habitat reduces a metapopulation's extinction risk by raising its average per-capita growth rate without causing any appreciable drop in its average population density. By contrast, dispersal in severely fragmented habitat raises a metapopulation's extinction risk because the rise in its average per-capita growth rate is more than offset by the decline in its average population density.

  abstract = {Most ecosystems are affected by anthropogenic or natural pulse disturbances, which alter the community composition and functioning for a limited period of time. Whether and how quickly communities recover from such pulses is central to our understanding of biodiversity dynamics and ecosystem organisation, but also to nature conservation and management. Here, we present a meta-analysis of 508 (semi-)natural field experiments globally distributed across marine, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. We found recovery to be significant yet incomplete. At the end of the experiments, disturbed treatments resembled controls again when considering abundance (94\%), biomass (82\%), and univariate diversity measures (88\%). Most disturbed treatments did not further depart from control after the pulse, indicating that few studies showed novel trajectories induced by the pulse. Only multivariate community composition on average showed little recovery: disturbed species composition remained dissimilar to the control throughout most experiments. Still, when experiments revealed a higher compositional stability, they tended to also show higher functional stability. Recovery was more complete when systems had high resistance, whereas resilience and resistance were negatively correlated. The overall results were highly consistent across studies, but significant differences between ecosystems and organism groups appeared. Future research on disturbances should aim to understand these differences, but also fill obvious gaps in the empirical assessments for regions (especially the tropics), ecosystems and organisms. In summary, we provide general evidence that (semi-)natural communities can recover from pulse disturbances, but compositional aspects are more vulnerable to long-lasting effects of pulse disturbance than the emergent functions associated to them.},

Interactions with competitors, consumers, mutualists, and facilitators can strongly influence local species distributions, but few studies assess how and whether these interactions will impede or accelerate climate change--induced range shifts. In this paper, we explore how ecologists might move forward on this question. We first outline the conditions under which biotic interactions can result in range shifts that proceed faster or slower than climate velocity and result in ecological surprises. Next, we use our own work to demonstrate that experimental studies documenting the strength of biotic interactions across large environmental gradients are a critical first step for understanding whether they will influence climate change--induced range shifts. Further progress could be made by integrating results from these studies into modeling frameworks to predict how or generalize when biotic interactions mediate how changing climates influence range shifts. Finally, we argue that many more case studies like those described here are needed to explore the importance of biotic interactions during climate change--induced range shifts.},

The speckled wood butterfly, Pararge aegeria, has undergone recent major expansions in its distribution: in the north of its range, P. aegeria has colonized many areas in north and east England, and in the south, it was first recorded on Madeira in 1976. We examined morphological traits associated with flight and reproduction in the northern subspecies tircis, and in the southern subspecies aegeria, from sites colonized about 20\,years ago in northern England and on Madeira, respectively. Investment in flight was measured as relative wing area and thorax mass, and investment in reproduction as relative abdomen mass. All measurements were from individuals reared in a common environment and there were significant family effects in most of the variables measured. Compared with individuals from sites continuously occupied in recent history, colonizing individuals were larger (adult live mass). In the subspecies tircis, colonizing individuals also had relatively larger thoraxes and lower wing aspect ratios indicating that evolutionary changes in flight morphology may be related to colonization. However, sex by site interactions in analyses of thorax mass and abdomen mass suggest different selection pressures on flight morphology between the sexes in relation to colonization. Overall, the subspecies aegeria was smaller (adult live mass) and had a relatively larger thorax and wings, and smaller abdomen than subspecies tircis. Evolutionary changes in flight morphology and dispersal rate may be important determinants of range expansion, and may affect responses to future climate change.},

  abstract = {Aim We analysed latitudinal range, centres of distribution and northern range boundaries of dragonflies and damselflies occurring in Europe and North America with respect to larval habitat (standing water = lentic and running water = lotic). As lentic water bodies are thought to be less predictable in space and time than lotic habitats, species adapted to standing waters depend on effective dispersal ability for long-term survival. If species occurring in lentic habitats have a higher propensity for dispersal, then larger range sizes in lentic than in lotic species, as well as an increase in the proportion of lentic species with latitude, would be expected. Location Europe, North America. Methods Distributional and habitat data were collected from published sources for all odonates of Europe and North America. Species were assigned to lentic and lotic habitats according to the habitat of the larvae. From distribution maps we estimated the latitudinal range, centre of distribution and northern range boundary of each species. Differences in these distribution variables between lentic and lotic species were evaluated using anova. We related the proportion of lentic species by latitudinal interval in Europe, and by political unit (state, province) in North America, to area, altitudinal range, longitude (only for North America) and latitude by means of generalized linear models. Results Lentic damselflies and dragonflies had larger latitudinal spans, and more northern distribution centres and range boundaries, than lotic species. The proportion of lentic species increased with latitude. These findings were consistent between continents. Main conclusions Our results support previous findings that distribution patterns of freshwater species depend on habitat preference. Evolution of dispersal propensity according to habitat characteristics is the most likely explanation. However, at present, alternative explanations, such as an increase in lentic habitats with latitude, cannot be ruled out.},

Female body sizes were converted to dry body weight. Variation in body weight and fecundity was expressed as percentage deviation from the median values. The increase in fecundity with body weight was similar in most taxa, with only a few important exceptions. The common regression for oviparous and larviparous species predicts a 0.95\% increase in median fecundity for each 1\% increase in dry body weight. The number of ovarioles (in 10 species of Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera and Orthoptera) also increased with body weight. The general relationship predicted a 0.81\% increase in ovariole number for each 1\% increase in dry body weight. The slope of ovariole number versus weight relationship was greater in species with many ovarioles than in species with few. The common slope of the fecundity/size relationship is close to 1 and this indicates that female size is a principal constraint on insect potential fecundity.},

Our aim was to evaluate whether fish exposed to glochidia have distinct behaviour that could affect the upstream dispersal of the parasite. Many freshwater mussels are highly endangered, and understanding the relationships with their hosts is important for their conservation. However, research on the behavioural effects of parasitism on fish host activity and/or the upstream dispersal of mussel larvae in nature has received little attention. Specifically, we examined a fish (the chub, Squalius cephalus) that hosts the larval stage of a freshwater bivalve (Anodonta anatina) and investigated alterations in host behaviour induced by the parasite. One laboratory and two field experiments were conducted using passive integrated transponder systems and radio-telemetry. Infected fish were generally less active in the laboratory and, in the field, dispersed less far upstream. Moreover, radio-telemetry revealed a habitat shift by the infected fish, which were found further from the riverbank. We suggest that behavioural changes in the fish that are induced by glochidia do not facilitate the long-distance dispersal of the mussel but rather cause reductions in fish activity and slight habitat shifts. Possible consequences of such behavioural alterations are discussed.},

Grooming can be energetically costly and may trade off with other host activities. We hypothesize that self-grooming comes at a cost and, therefore, compromises future parasite resistance and other energetically expensive activities, namely flight. We measured the rates of CO2 production (respiration is a proxy for energetic costs) in Drosophila nigrospiracula induced to groom with a non-pathogenic irritant (volcanic ash), allowing us to disentangle the cost of grooming from the cost of infection. The respiration rate of flies induced to groom was significantly higher compared to flies at rest. Results show that flies that spent time grooming, induced by an irritant, had higher average infection intensities upon subsequent exposure to the ectoparasitic mite Macrocheles subbadius. Additionally, flies induced to groom with an irritant suffered a {\textasciitilde}\,30\% reduction in flight performance compared to flies previously at rest, suggesting reduced ability to escape infested habitats. Lastly, we compared the behavioral response of flies to ectoparasites and irritants, as flies may be specific in their response to different types of threats. Behavioral observations revealed that flies exposed to an irritant increased self-grooming behavior and decreased movement (potentially suggesting reduced escape behavior), whereas flies exposed to mites exhibited increased ambulatory movement as well as increased grooming behavior. Overall, time spent grooming made flies more vulnerable to future infection and decreased flight endurance, a metric of dispersal capability.},

The plant Asclepias syriaca (Common Milkweed) relies on pollinators for movement of its pollen and evidence suggests that it has recently been declining. Given these factors and this plant's importance as a host species for the declining Danaus plexippus (Monarch Butterfly), it is critical to determine if its flowering is being modified by climate change. As a first step to answering this question I quantified the relationship between climate and flowering date~for A. syriaca using data from the USA National Phenology Network repository and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. I found that temperatures were higher than they had been historically (1895--2010) and mean flowering dates occurred earlier with higher temperatures. Additionally, there is a significant negative interactive effect of temperature and year on flowering date indicating that from 2011 through 2016 higher temperatures are correlated with increasingly earlier flowering dates. The change in flowering appears to be symmetrical in regards to the flowering time distribution, in that along with the mean, both maximum and minimum flowering dates are occurring earlier, as well. There is no evidence that earlier flowering is due to earlier initial growth or results in later fruit ripening. Consequences of this shift in flowering can only be speculated upon at this point, but due to the ecological importance of A. syriaca and its susceptibility to phenological mismatch, they should be considered when developing conservation plans for A. syriaca and the organisms for which it is a host.},

We focused on breeding cowbirds' use of forest because of the risk of nest parasitism to forest-dwelling hosts and to identify factors affecting breeding cowbird habitat selection. We compared distances of cowbird locations in the forest from the forest edge (``edge distances'') to distances of random forest locations in the entire landscape or within individual cowbird home ranges. We analyzed 1322 locations of 84 cowbirds across three landscapes. We found support for the landscape context hypothesis that breeding cowbird preference for forest edge varied with landscape context. Ninety percent of cowbird locations were within 150--350~m of forest edge, despite the overall availability of forest at greater distances from edge (as far as 500--1450~m) both within cowbird home ranges and the entire forested landscape. Cowbird preference for edge varied by landscape context largely due to differences in the availability of forest edge. In a highly fragmented forest cowbirds utilized the entire forest and likely viewed it as ``all edge.'' In less fragmented forests, cowbirds preferred edge. We consider how variation in cowbird edge preference might relate to patterns in host abundance, host diversity, and host quality because cowbird movements indicate they are capable of using forest farther from edges.},

Therefore, one might predict that populations living in heterogeneous environments have higher adaptive potential than populations living in homogeneous environments. Such a prediction could be useful in guiding conservation priorities without requiring detailed genetic studies. However, this prediction will be true only if the additional genetic variation maintained by environmental heterogeneity can be used to respond to novel selection. Here we examine the effect of environmental heterogeneity on future adaptability using replicated experimental Drosophila melanogaster populations that had previously evolved for {$\sim$}100 generations under one of four selective regimes: constant salt-enriched larvae medium, constant cadmium-enriched larvae medium, and two heterogeneous regimes that vary either temporally or spatially between the two media. Replicates of these experimental populations were subjected to a novel heat stress while being maintained in their original larval diet selection regimes. Adaptation to increased temperature was measured with respect to female productivity and male siring success after {$\sim$}20 generations. For female productivity, there was evidence of adaptation overall and heterogeneous populations had a larger adaptive response than homogeneous populations. There was less evidence of adaptation overall for male siring success and no support for faster adaptation in heterogeneous populations.},

First, species loss rate slows down with the age of the isolate, a strong and general pattern largely unnoticed so far. Secondly, while being good candidates in the light of previous works, DD models fail to account for this pattern, a result that necessitates a search for other mechanisms. Thirdly, a simple diversity-independent model based on area (converted into population size) and age explains 97\% of the variability in species loss rate and appears to be a promising predictive tool to handle extinction debt following habitat loss.},

Temperature change also alters food web structure and function, but potential interactions between warming and intraspecific behavioral variation are largely unexplored. We aimed to test how increased temperature, individual activity level of a predatory backswimmer (Anisops assimilis), and their interaction influenced the strength of top-down control of zooplankton and phytoplankton. We used stable isotopes to support our assumption that the study population of A. assimilis is zooplanktivorous, and behavioral trials to confirm that activity level is a repeatable trait. We established freshwater microcosms to test for effects of warming, backswimmer presence, and backswimmer behavioral type on zooplankton density, zooplankton composition, and phytoplankton chlorophyll a. Top-down control was present and was generally stronger at increased temperature. There was no indication that predator behavioral type influenced the strength of top-down control either on its own or interactively with temperature. Predator behavioral type may not be associated with ecologically important function in this species at the temporal and spatial scales addressed in this study, but the links between behavior, temperature, and food web processes are worthy of broader exploration.},

A growing number of empirical studies demonstrate positive diversity-stability relationships. These studies, however, have emphasized only a few types of stability, and they rarely uncover the mechanisms responsible for stability. Because anthropogenic changes often affect stability and diversity simultaneously, diversity-stability relationships cannot be understood outside the context of the environmental drivers affecting both. This shifts attention away from diversity-stability relationships toward the multiple factors, including diversity, that dictate the stability of ecosystems.},

However, numerous important questions remain unanswered on the actual effectiveness of such ecological road mitigation projects. We used specially adapted time-lapse recording cameras and a custom image analysis script to monitor the amphibian usage and effectiveness of a multi-tunnel mitigation site in northern England over 4~years and used before-and-after pond survey data to evaluate the mitigation results from a population trend perspective. We monitored four amphibian species, including the European protected great crested newt (Triturus cristatus), the main target of amphibian road mitigation in the UK. Despite substantial evidence of mitigation rejection and U-turn movements inside the tunnels, overall, most amphibians entering tunnels successfully used them to move between the different parts of the site separated by the road. Road fences appeared effective for preventing amphibian road mortality and site connectivity was re-established via the wildlife passage system, with multiple new ponds across the road colonised by amphibians. Unlike frogs and toads, tunnel usage by newts was strongly autumn based, indicating that such systems are mainly suitable for supporting newt dispersal movements between breeding areas. The great crested newt population increased rapidly over the course of the monitoring period, suggesting that, together with habitat replacements and improvements, the road mitigation measures were effective at maintaining site connectivity and as a population conservation measure.},

This finer-grained definition can explain a number of previous results, including (1) that the storage effect promotes annual plant coexistence when the germination rate fluctuates, but not when the seed yield fluctuates, (2) that the storage effect is more likely to be induced by resource competition than the apparent competition, and (3) why the storage effect arises readily in models with either stage structure or environmental autocorrelation. Additionally, our expanded definition suggests two novel mechanisms by which the temporal storage effect can arise---transgenerational plasticity and causal chains of environmental variables---thus suggesting that the storage effect is a more common phenomenon than previously thought.},

It is suggested that when temperature and daylength are high and long enough to suppress sexual development in aphids, they also suppress alate development, but alate development can proceed in the presence of other factors such as crowding and poor host plant. The threshold of response of aphids to these stimuli is influenced by the temperature and photoperiod which they have experienced.

  abstract = {Dispersal plays a crucial role in many aspects of species' life histories, yet is often difficult to measure directly. This is particularly true for many insects, especially nocturnal species (e.g. moths) that cannot be easily observed under natural field conditions. Consequently, over the past five decades, laboratory tethered flight techniques have been developed as a means of measuring insect flight duration and speed. However, these previous designs have tended to focus on single species (typically migrant pests), and here we describe an improved apparatus that allows the study of flight ability in a wide range of insect body sizes and types. Obtaining dispersal information from a range of species is crucial for understanding insect population dynamics and range shifts. Our new laboratory tethered flight apparatus automatically records flight duration, speed, and distance of individual insects. The rotational tethered flight mill has very low friction and the arm to which flying insects are attached is extremely lightweight while remaining rigid and strong, permitting both small and large insects to be studied. The apparatus is compact and thus allows many individuals to be studied simultaneously under controlled laboratory conditions. We demonstrate the performance of the apparatus by using the mills to assess the flight capability of 24 species of British noctuid moths, ranging in size from 12--27 mm forewing length ( 40--660 mg body mass). We validate the new technique by comparing our tethered flight data with existing information on dispersal ability of noctuids from the published literature and expert opinion. Values for tethered flight variables were in agreement with existing knowledge of dispersal ability in these species, supporting the use of this method to quantify dispersal in insects. Importantly, this new technology opens up the potential to investigate genetic and environmental factors affecting insect dispersal among a wide range of species.},

  abstract = {Rising global temperatures force many species to shift their distribution ranges. However, whether or not (and how fast) such range shifts occur depends on species' dispersal capacities. In most ecological studies, dispersal-related traits (such as the wing size or wing loading in insects) are treated as fixed, species-specific characteristics, ignoring the important role of phenotypic plasticity during insect development. We tested the hypothesis that dispersal-related traits themselves vary in dependence of ambient environmental conditions (temperature regimes, discharge patterns and biotic interactions during individual development). We collected data over 8 years from a natural population of the crane fly Tipula maxima in central Germany. Using linear mixed-effect models, we analysed how phenotypic traits, phenological characteristics and population densities are affected by environmental conditions during the preceding 3, 6 and 12 months. We found a moderate (5.6\%) increase in wing length per 1{$^\circ$}C increase in mean annual temperatures during the previous year. At the same time, body weight increased by as much as 17.8\% in females and 26.9\% in males per 1{$^\circ$}C, likely driven by increased habitat productivity, which resulted in a 16.4\% (female) and 19.3\% (male) increased wing loading. We further found a shorter, more synchronized emergence period (i.e. a narrower time frame for dispersal) with increasing temperatures. Altogether, our results suggest that dispersal abilities of T. maxima were negatively affected by elevated temperatures, and we discuss how similar patterns might affect the persistence of populations of other aquatic insects, especially stenoecious taxa with narrow distribution ranges. Our study calls for integration of information on temperature-induced phenotypic plasticity of dispersal-related traits into models forecasting range shifts in the face of climate change. Furthermore, the patterns reported here are likely to affect metapopulation dynamics of aquatic insects under climate change conditions and may contribute to the ongoing decline of insect biomass and diversity.},

The larval development consists of series of stages in which each stage is separated from the next by a molt. It's a complex process involving hormones, proteins and enzymes. Insects grow in increments. The molting is the process through which insects can routinely cast off their exoskeleton during specific times in their life cycle. The insect form in between two subsequent molts is termed as instar. The number of instars varies from 3 to 40~in different insect orders depending on the surrounding environmental and other conditions such as inheritance, sex, food quality and quantity.

Parasite populations should be locally adapted, having higher mean fitness on sympatric than allopatric hosts. Here we assess evidence for local parasite advantage. Further we investigate how adaptation and counter-adaptation of parasites and hosts, necessarily occurring in sympatry, can generate a pattern of local adaptation. Already simple frequency-dependent selection models generate complex patterns of parasite performance on sympatric and allopatric populations. In metapopulations, with extinction, recolonization, and gene flow, variable selection pressure and stochasticity may obscure local processes or change the level at which local adaptation occurs. Alternatively, gene flow may introduce adaptive variation, so differential migration rates can modify the asymmetry of host and parasite evolutionary rates. We conclude that local adaptation is an average phenomenon. Its detection requires adequate replication at the appropriate level, that at which the local processes occur.},

To solve this problem, we have developed SkitoSnack, a formulated diet for Aedes aegypti (L) mosquitoes, as an alternative for vertebrate blood. Here we addressed the question if long-term yellow fever mosquito culture with SkitoSnack resulted in changed life history traits and fitness of the offspring compared to blood-raised mosquitoes. We also explored if SkitoSnack is suitable to raise Asian tiger mosquitos, Aedes albopictus (L.), and the human bed bug, Cimex lectularius (L). We measured life history traits for 30th generation SkitoSnack-raised Ae. aegypti and 11th generation SkitoSnack-raised Ae. albopictus, and compared them with control mosquitoes raised on blood only. We compared meal preference, flight performance, and reproductive fitness in Ae. aegypti raised on SkitoSnack or blood. We also offered SkitoSnack to bed bug nymphs. We found that long-term culture with SkitoSnack resulted in mosquitoes with similar life history traits compared to bovine blood-raised mosquitoes in both species we studied. Also, Ae. aegypti mosquitoes raised on SkitoSnack had similar flight performance compared to blood raised mosquitoes, were still strongly attracted by human smell and had equal mating success. Minimal feeding occurred in bed bugs. Our results suggest that long-term culture with the blood-meal replacement SkitoSnack results in healthy, fit mosquitoes. Therefore, artificial diets like SkitoSnack can be considered as a viable alternative for vertebrate blood in laboratory mosquito culture as well as for mosquito mass production for Sterile-Insect-Technique mosquito control interventions. SkitoSnack was not suitable to induce engorgement of bed bugs.},

  abstract = {Aphids display wing polyphenism, and the mother can produce a wingless morph for reproduction and a winged morph for dispersal. It is believed that the wingless morph is an adaptive status under favorable conditions and is determined prenatally. In this study, we have found that winged nymphs of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, can change from winged to wingless during normal development. Our results showed that winged nymphs could become the wingless morph by apterization in response to changes from stressful to favorable conditions. The acquired wingless aphids had higher fecundity than the winged morph. However, this process of regression from winged to wingless morph was inhibited by Serratia symbiotica. The existence of the symbiont did not affect the body mass and fecundity of adult aphids, but it increased the body weight of nymphs and temporally increased the quantity of a primary symbiont, Buchnera aphidicola. Our results showed that despite temporal improvement of living conditions causing the induction of apterization of winged nymphs, the inhibition effect of S. symbiotica on this process was activated simultaneously. This finding, for the first time, reveals that the wingless morph can be changed postnatally, which explains a novel regulating mechanism of wing polyphenism driven by external abiotic stimuli and internal biotic regulation together in aphids.IMPORTANCE Wing polyphenism is an important adaptative response to environmental changes for aphids. Endosymbionts are widespread in aphids and also confer the ability to withstand unfavorable conditions. However, little is known about whether endosymbionts are involved in the wing polyphenism. In this study, we report a new finding that winged nymphs of the pea aphid could turn into adults without wings or wing-related structures through apterization when winged nymphs escaped from stressful to favorable environments. Further analysis revealed that the facultative symbiont S. symbiotica could prevent the temporal determination of the host in wing suppression by inhibiting apterization, to enhance its spread. Our findings provide a novel angle to understanding the wing polyphenism regulation of aphids.},

  abstract = {In many species of animals chemical stimuli are an important source of information about the threats and dangers present in the social and non-social world. Olfactory cues play a fundamental role in modulating social recognition and interactions in a wide variety of mammals. Rodents, in particular, utilize chemical signals, to recognize and avoid conspecifics infected with parasites and other pathogens. Animals also respond to, and utilize, predator odor related information to assess and minimize their risk of predation. In this review, we briefly focus on the relations between odors, parasite recognition and avoidance and consider some of the associated hormonal, neural and genomic mechanisms. We describe how both male and female rodents distinguish between infected and uninfected males on the basis of odors, displaying aversive response to, and avoidance of, the urine odors of infected individuals. We further describe how the recognition and avoidance of the odors of infected individuals involves genes for the neuropeptide, oxytocin, (OT), and estrogenic mechanisms. We show that mice with deletions of the oxytocin gene (OT knockout mice (OTKO)) and mice whose genes for estrogen receptor (ER)-{$\alpha$} or ER-{$\beta$} [ER knockout mice (ERKO), {$\alpha$}ERKO and {$\beta$}ERKO] have been disrupted are specifically impaired in their recognition, avoidance, and memory of the odors of infected individuals. We contrast this with the recognition and display of aversive responses to predator (cat) odor that are insensitive to these genetic manipulations. These findings reveal some of the mechanisms associated with the olfactory mediated recognition of parasitized individuals and predators.},

  abstract = {Determining the factors that limit abundance and biomass of fish is fundamental to effective fisheries management. In streams, pool availability, cover, and habitat complexity often limit fish---particularly salmonids---and many restoration efforts are directed toward addressing physical habitat factors. However, the availability of prey, and the factors that influence prey abundance, can also influence the abundance, biomass, and growth of fish and other consumers. Both habitat and prey availability can be influenced by characteristics of the riparian forest in headwaters. In this study, we evaluate how variables associated with stream habitat, primary production, and macroinvertebrate biomass account for variability in the biomass of cutthroat trout and total vertebrates (fish and salamanders) across a series of paired stream reaches with contrasting forest structure. Each of nine stream pairs consisted of an old-growth reach and a reach bordered by 40- to 60-yr-old second-growth riparian forest. We evaluated relationships between response and explanatory variables for each forest structure type using correlation analysis, regression analysis, and AICc model comparison analyses. We also conducted correlation and regression analyses on within-stream reach pair differences across the nine study streams. Canopy openness, nitrate concentration, periphyton chlorophyll a accrual, total invertebrate biomass, predatory invertebrate biomass, cutthroat trout biomass, and total vertebrate biomass were all positively correlated with each other, while temperature was negatively correlated with biotic variables. Within reach pairs, canopy openness emerged as the strongest correlate with top predators, with differences in canopy openness explaining 84\% of the variation in vertebrate biomass differences in the paired analysis. Other habitat metrics were poorly correlated with invertebrate, fish, and salamander biomass for all analyses. Overall, these results suggest that for the stream reaches surveyed here, resource availability---as regulated through bottom-up, autotrophic pathways---is a dominant control on fish and other consumers. This highlights the importance of food resource limitation for fish and top predators in headwater streams, and illustrates how differences in canopy structure can affect bottom-up drivers of stream food webs.},

  abstract = {Climate change affects species and their interactions, resulting in novel communities and modified ecosystem processes. Through shifts in phenology and distribution, climatic change can disrupt interactions, including those between mutualists. Mutualisms influence the structure and stability of communities and can link species to a common fate. However, research on climate change has focused on pairwise mutualisms, neglecting the higher-order interactions that can arise when species interact with multiple mutualists. We explore the effects of climate change on tripartite interactions involving belowground mutualists, namely soil bacteria and fungi, flowering plants, and pollinators. We outline how climate change is predicted to affect the phenology and distribution of these belowground mutualists, emphasizing the consequent effects on host plant floral traits, plant-pollinator interactions, and bee behavior. We find evidence that warming, advanced snowmelt, and drought are likely to cause phenological and distributional shifts in soil microbes, leading to diminished mutualistic interactions with plants and symbiont switching. Consequently, shifts in flowering phenology, smaller floral displays, and lower quality floral rewards are expected, increasing foraging time and energy demands for bees and altering their floral preferences. Such costs could translate into reduced fitness and novel selection pressures for bees and flowering plants in the short term. We highlight knowledge gaps and ways forward, urging studies on microbe dispersal and phenological cues, experiments that manipulate soil microbe-host plant interactions under simulated climate change conditions, and large-scale field studies across environmental gradients, all with the goal of understanding how climate change will affect soil microbe-plant-pollinator mutualisms.},

  abstract = {Zoonotic diseases are infectious diseases of humans caused by pathogens that are shared between humans and other vertebrate animals. Previously, pristine natural areas with high biodiversity were seen as likely sources of new zoonotic pathogens, suggesting that biodiversity could have negative impacts on human health. At the same time, biodiversity has been recognized as potentially benefiting human health by reducing the transmission of some pathogens that have already established themselves in human populations. These apparently opposing effects of biodiversity in human health may now be reconcilable. Recent research demonstrates that some taxa are much more likely to be zoonotic hosts than others are, and that these animals often proliferate in human-dominated landscapes, increasing the likelihood of spillover. In less-disturbed areas, however, these zoonotic reservoir hosts are less abundant and nonreservoirs predominate. Thus, biodiversity loss appears to increase the risk of human exposure to both new and established zoonotic pathogens. This new synthesis of the effects of biodiversity on zoonotic diseases presents an opportunity to articulate the next generation of research questions that can inform management and policy. Future studies should focus on collecting and analyzing data on the diversity, abundance, and capacity to transmit of the taxa that actually share zoonotic pathogens with us. To predict and prevent future epidemics, researchers should also focus on how these metrics change in response to human impacts on the environment, and how human behaviors can mitigate these effects. Restoration of biodiversity is an important frontier in the management of zoonotic disease risk.},

Day-active parasitoids experiencing longer summer days associated with a poleward range shift display increased attack rates on their aphid hosts and have higher lifetime fecundity. Theory consequently predicts that with increasing photoperiod, host--parasitoid interactions would become less stable with more variable population densities and increased extinction probability. To test this prediction empirically, we conducted a multigenerational aphid-parasitoid microcosm experiment in which we followed population dynamics under 14 and 18 h daylight treatments. As predicted, we found an increased extinction rate of both aphids and parasitoids with longer daylengths. The long-day treatments also exhibited higher temporal variation in parasitoid numbers and increased cumulative parasitoid population size, consistent with the prediction that increased aphid extinctions are due to increased parasitoid attack rates. Our results demonstrate that light regime can affect the dynamics of interacting species and potentially limit the co-existence of hosts and parasitoids, as well as other trophically interacting taxa where activity patterns are dependent on the light regime. This highlights the importance of the rarely considered effect of changing daylight conditions associated with climate change--driven range shifts, which could limit poleward range shifts due to changing ecological interactions.},

  abstract = {Many organisms are experiencing changing daily light regimes due to latitudinal range shifts driven by climate change and increased artificial light at night (ALAN). Activity patterns are often driven by light cycles, which will have important consequences for species interactions. We tested whether longer photoperiods lead to higher parasitism rates by a day-active parasitoid on its host using a laboratory experiment in which we independently varied daylength and the presence of ALAN. We then tested whether reduced nighttime temperature tempers the effect of ALAN. We found that parasitism rate increased with daylength, with ALAN intensifying this effect only when the temperature was not reduced at night. The impact of ALAN was more pronounced under short daylength. Increased parasitoid activity was not compensated for by reduced life span, indicating that increased daylength leads to an increase in total parasitism effects on fitness. To test the significance of increased parasitism rate for population dynamics, we developed a host--parasitoid model. The results of the model predicted an increase in time-to-equilibrium with increased daylength and, crucially, a threshold daylength above which interactions are unstable, leading to local extinctions. Here we demonstrate that ALAN impact interacts with daylength and temperature by changing the interaction strength between a common day-active consumer species and its host in a predictable way. Our results further suggest that range expansion or ALAN-induced changes in light regimes experienced by insects and their natural enemies will result in unstable dynamics beyond key tipping points in daylength.},

Daylength is a major factor affecting insect life cycles and activity patterns, so a range shift leading to new daylength regimes is likely to affect population dynamics and species interactions; however, the impact of daylength in isolation on ecological communities has not been studied so far. Here, we tested for the direct and indirect effects of two different daylengths on the dynamics of experimental multitrophic insect communities. We compared the community dynamics under ``southern'' summer conditions of 14.5-hr daylight to ``northern'' summer conditions of 22-hr daylight. We show that food web dynamics indeed respond to daylength with one aphid species (Acyrthosiphon pisum) reaching much lower population sizes at the northern daylength regime compared to under southern conditions. In contrast, in the same communities, another aphid species (Megoura viciae) reached higher population densities under northern conditions. This effect at the aphid level was driven by an indirect effect of daylength causing a change in competitive interaction strengths, with the different aphid species being more competitive at different daylength regimes. Additionally, increasing daylength also increased growth rates in M. viciae making it more competitive under summer long days. As such, the shift in daylength affected aphid population sizes by both direct and indirect effects, propagating through species interactions.

Our results demonstrate that range expansion of whole communities due to climate change can indeed change interaction strengths between species within ecological communities with consequences for community dynamics.

That contention is challenged here. The importance of Type I errors is discussed as well as the occurrence of Type I errors in biological experiments. Also considered is the effect of Type I error protection on power. The two methods of measuring Type I error rate, comparisonwise and experimentwise, are explained, and the reader may decide which kind he wishes to control. Several references cited support Fisher's least significant difference and Duncan's new multiple range test despite their higher-than-nominal experimentwise Type I error rates. These procedures control the comparisonwise Type I error rates and are considerably more powerful in finding differences among treatments than procedures that control the experimentwise Type I error rates.},

Alle Versuche wurden unter Standardbedingungen (Nahrung, Licht, Wassermenge pro Individuum, Wasserqualit{\"a}t) durchgef{\"u}hrt. Die Intensit{\"a}t von Wachstum, H{\"a}utungsfolge, Herzfrequenz, Eiproduktion und Embryonalentwicklung ist unter gleichen Umweltbedingungen {\"a}hnlich der von dem vorher untersuchten G. salinus (Kinne, 1960) vom gleichen Biotop. G. zaddachi und G. salinus unterscheiden sich jedoch hinsichtlich der Intensit{\"a}t dieser Lebensprozesse eindeutig von einer dritten Gammarus Art des Kleinen Kiels, n{\"a}mlich von G. duebeni. Letzterer zeigt unter gleichen Bedingungen viel geringere Intensit{\"a}ten (Kinne, 1952 b; 1953 a, b). Die Intervalle zwischen zwei aufeinanderfolgenden H{\"a}utungen sind bei den G. zaddachi M{\"a}nnchen l{\"a}nger als bei den Weibchen. In den Salzgehaltsstufen 5 ‰, 10 ‰ und 30 ‰ wurden keine eindeutigen Unterschiede festgestellt. Ohne M{\"a}nnchen gehaltene Weibchen zeigen eine Tendenz zur Verl{\"a}ngerung der Intervalle, und zwar beginnend mit dem dritten oder vierten Intervall nach erfolgter Isolation. Bei 17-21 mm langen M{\"a}nnchen und 14-16 mm langen Weibchen konnte keine Beziehung zwischen K{\"o}rperl{\"a}nge und Herzfrequenz nachgewiesen werden. Eine derartige Beziehung besteht jedoch bei gr{\"o}sseren L{\"a}ngenunterschieden: Die Herzfrequenz ist deutlich h{\"o}her bei 5-6 mm langen Jungtieren. In den Salzgehaltsstufen 5 ‰ und 10 ‰ wurden keine signifikanten Unterschiede in der Herzfrequenz adulter Tiere festgestellt. Die Anzahl der Marsupialeier pro Weibchen einer gegebenen L{\"a}nge h{\"a}ngt ab von der Temperatur (14{$^\circ$}-16{$^\circ$} C \&gt 18{$^\circ$}-20{$^\circ$} C) und vom Salzgehalt. Es besteht eine lineare Beziehung zwischen der Eizahl und dem Volumen (L{\"a}nge {$^3$}) des Muttertieres (Ausnahme: senile Weibchen). In Abwesenheit eines M{\"a}nnchens wird die Anzahl der abgelegten Eier in zunehmendem Mass reduziert. Eine normale Eizahl wird gew{\"o}hnlich nur deponiert im Anschluss an eine Sperma{\"u}bertragung. Neben der funktionellen {\"A}hnlichkeit von G. zaddachi und G. salinus besteht eine bemerkenswerte strukturelle {\"A}hnlichkeit zwischen diesen beiden Arten (Spooner, 1947; Segerstr{\aa}le, 1947; Kinne, 1954, etc.). Die vorliegenden Informationen dr{\"a}ngen zu der Annahme, dass G. zaddachi und G. salinus zwei relativ junge Arten repr{\"a}sentieren, die erst k{\"u}rzlich ihre genetische Selbst{\"a}ndigkeit erlangt haben (siehe auch Spooner, 1947, 1951; und Kinne, 1954).

  abstract = {Several recent models have shown that altruism can spread in viscous populations, i.e. in spatially structured populations within which individuals interact only with their immediate neighbours and disperse only over short distances. I first confirm this result with an individual--based model of a viscous population, where an individual can vary its level of investment into a behaviour that is beneficial to its neighbours but costly to itself. Two distinct classes of individuals emerge: egoists with no or very little investment into altruism, and altruists with a high level of investment; intermediate levels of altruism are not maintained. I then extend the model to investigate the consequences of letting interaction and dispersal distances evolve along with altruism. Altruists maintain short distances, while the egoists respond to the spread of altruism by increasing their interaction and dispersal distances. This allows the egoistic individuals to be maintained in the population at a high frequency. Furthermore, the coevolution of investment into altruism and interaction distance can lead to a stable spatial pattern, where stripes of altruists (with local interactions) alternate with stripes of egoists (with far--reaching interactions). Perhaps most importantly, this approach shows that the ease with which altruism spreads in viscous populations is maintained despite countermeasures evolved by egoists.},

  abstract = {Almost all aphids harbour an endosymbiotic bacterium, Buchnera aphidicola, in bacteriocytes. Buchnera synthesizes essential nutrients and supports growth and reproduction of the host. Over the long history of endosymbiosis, many essential genes have been lost from the Buchnera genome, resulting in drastic genome reduction and the inability to live outside the host cells. In turn, when deprived of Buchnera, the host aphid suffers retarded growth and sterility. Buchnera and the host aphid are often referred to as highly integrated almost inseparable mutualistic partners. However, we discovered that, even after complete elimination of Buchnera, infection with a facultative endosymbiotic ?-proteobacterium called pea aphid secondary symbiont (PASS) enabled survival and reproduction of the pea aphid. In the Buchnera-free aphid, PASS infected the cytoplasms of bacteriocytes that normally harbour Buchnera, establishing a novel endosymbiotic system. These results indicate that PASS can compensate for the essential role of Buchnera by physiologically and cytologically taking over the symbiotic niche. By contrast, PASS negatively affected the growth and reproduction of normal host aphids by suppressing the essential symbiont Buchnera. These findings illuminate complex symbiont-symbiont and host-symbiont interactions in an endosymbiotic system, and suggest a possible evolutionary route to novel obligate endosymbiosis by way of facultative endosymbiotic associations.},

The normal paddling rate was established at approximately 31.6 flaps per minute (FPM) under controlled conditions of 30{$^\circ$}C, pH 6.8, and 50\% sunlight exposure. When exposed to increased pH levels, the paddling rate exhibited a significant increase, rising by nearly 75\% compared to the normal rate. Conversely, a decrease in pH led to an even greater enhancement in paddling activity, with a rise of approximately 90\%. A notable 321 response was observed under increased temperature, where the paddling rate surged by more than 2.6 times than expected, indicating a strong sensitivity to thermal changes. The most reduction in paddling activity occurred under low light intensity, with the rate plummeting to roughly 37\% of the normal value. The findings underscore the susceptibility of N. glauca to variations in these key environmental parameters, particularly highlighting its heightened response to temperature fluctuations and low light conditions. The species of interest is observed as ecological sentinels and understanding its optimum limit of tolerance over fundamental physical parameters enables us to estimate the effect of climate change, environmental modifications and habitat alterations over the course of time.},

  abstract = {Bioclimate envelope models (BEMs) have often been criticized as being too simplistic due to e.g. not incorporating effects of biotic interactions or evolutionary adaptation. However, BEMs are widely applied and have proven to be often useful. Here we investigate, under which conditions evolution of dispersal, local adaptation or interspecific competition may be of minor importance for forecasting future range shifts. Therefore we use individual-based simulations of metapopulations under climate change living in spatial temperature gradients. Scenarios incorporate single-species systems or systems with competing species, respectively. Dispersal rate is evolving and adaptation to local conditions may also evolve in some scenarios. Results show that in single-species scenarios excluding evolutionary adaptation, species either follow optimal habitat conditions or go extinct if habitat connectivity is too low. These simulations are in close accordance to predictions from BEMs. Including evolutionary adaptation qualitatively changes these results. In the absence of competing species the species either completely invades the world or goes extinct. With competitors, results strongly depend on habitat fragmentation. For highly connected habitats the range border may shift as predicted by BEMs, for intermediate connectivity it will lag behind, while species will go extinct if fragmentation is too high. Our results indicate that (simple) BEMs may work well if habitats are well connected and species will not encounter many difficulties in dispersing to new sites. Selection in this case may promote evolution of even higher dispersal activities. We thus show that the presence of biotic interactions may be ignored for predictions of range shifts when high dispersal can be expected.},

  abstract = {Rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) is a pivotal source for natural rubber production. Polyisoprene is synthesized in laticifer vessels, which are developed from vascular cambium in the phloem area of the inner bark tissue. The transcription factors and phytohormones were reported to be involved in network regulation of plant vascular tissue differentiation. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) was reported to act as a stimulator for laticifer vessel formation in rubber tree, but the regulatory mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, the correlation of laticifer vessel proliferation in phloem tissue upon MeJA treatment and the MeJA-responsive gene expression was investigated. Histochemical study of the laticifer revealed the circle and diffused structure around the secondary phloem of the stem. The number of laticifer vessels was increased from the top shoot to the lower stem part. The higher average number of laticifer vessels in stems of high latex-producing clones than in low latex/high wood yield clones suggested the correlation of laticifer vessel number and latex yield potential. This study demonstrated the temporal differential expression of MeJA-responsive genes upon MeJA treatment and adjusted back to a normal level after 3~months in two high latex-producing clones. The increasing number of laticifer vessels in MeJA-treated plants confirmed the consequent effect of MeJA treatment, and the possible roles of these genes in relation with laticifer vessel proliferation are discussed. A better understanding of gene function in laticifer development would be beneficial in rubber tree improvement and exploitation.},

However, distribution models that predict climate-induced range shifts do not account for spatial variation in dispersal. We developed an eco-genetic model to investigate how variation in dispersal distances across a species' range could interact with climate-induced selection and alter predicted range dynamics in a species with documented variation in dispersal traits. Location We investigated the range of an annual plant, Cakile edentula var. lacustris, which occupies beaches spanning a 555 km latitudinal gradient along the Laurentian Great Lakes. Methods We built a hybrid model that combines climatic niche modelling, based on decadal climate projections, with an individual-based model that allows for evolutionary processes to act upon a heritable dispersal kernel. We evaluated how spatial variation in dispersal distance and dispersal evolution influenced range dynamics, spatial and temporal variation in dispersal, and the distribution of neutral genetic variation. The model was parametrized with data on C. edentula's distribution, life history and dispersal characteristics. Results Geographic variation in dispersal distance, adaptive dispersal evolution and dispersal distance increased the potential for local populations of C. edentula to keep pace with changing climatic conditions through range shifts. Dispersal distances always increased at the expanding and contracting range edges when dispersal was allowed to evolve. Furthermore, scenarios where dispersal distances were initially lower at the range edges resulted in the largest evolutionary changes over 105 years ({$>$}1.5 km increase in mean distance at northern edge). Adaptive dispersal evolution always reduced neutral genetic diversity across the species' range. Main conclusions Variation in dispersal abilities across C. edentula's range and adaptive evolution led to different predicted outcomes in range dynamics during climate change illustrating the importance of including spatial variation in dispersal into species distribution models.},

Ambitious targets have been proposed, such as reversing the declining trends in biodiversity3; however, just feeding the growing human population will make this a challenge4. Here we use an ensemble of land-use and biodiversity models to assess whether---and how---humanity can reverse the declines in terrestrial biodiversity caused by habitat conversion, which is a major threat to biodiversity5. We show that immediate efforts, consistent with the broader sustainability agenda but of unprecedented ambition and coordination, could enable the provision of food for the growing human population while reversing the global terrestrial biodiversity trends caused by habitat conversion. If we decide to increase the extent of land under conservation management, restore degraded land and generalize landscape-level conservation planning, biodiversity trends from habitat conversion could become positive by~the mid-twenty-first century on average across models (confidence interval, 2042--2061), but this was not the case for all models. Food prices could increase and, on average across models, almost half (confidence interval, 34--50\%) of the future biodiversity losses could not be avoided. However, additionally tackling the drivers of land-use change could avoid conflict with affordable food provision and reduces the environmental effects of the food-provision system. Through further sustainable intensification and trade, reduced food waste and more plant-based human diets, more than two thirds of future biodiversity losses are avoided and the biodiversity trends from habitat conversion are reversed by 2050 for almost all of the models. Although limiting further loss will remain challenging in several biodiversity-rich regions, and other threats---such as climate change---must be addressed to truly reverse the declines in biodiversity, our results show that ambitious conservation efforts and food system transformation are central to an effective post-2020 biodiversity strategy.},

Adult apterae crowded together in groups of ten for 24 hr produce successive batches of progeny containing alatae and apterae in varying proportions, the number of alatae tending to fall as parturition proceeds. Control aphids isolated in tubes for the same length of time produce only apterous daughters. Crowding effects are therefore due to interactions between the aphids themselves and are not caused by starvation. The response is maternal and begins to appear in the fourth instar. Younger larvae are insensitive. The development of the crowding response is related to the frequency of the encounters between aphids. This was shown by varying either the population density or the size of the container. However, two individuals are adequate to constitute a `crowd', provided the volume of the `arena' is not too great. The contacts must extend over several hours. Overcrowding tends to reduce the response intensity. The sensory mechanisms of the crowding response have been examined. Visual and olfactory stimulation, as well as the exchange of pheromones, can be excuded. Since contacts are required, the relevant sense is probably that of touch. The mechanoreceptors are doubtless the thick-walled articulated bristles on the legs, antennae, and body. Antennal amputation, which removes all the known chemosensilla, fails to abolish the response. Artificial tactile stimulation has so far failed to elicit alata-production. But a variety of alien insects, such as small cockroaches or the beetle Ptinus tectus, are efficient `aphid substitutes'. Insects that are too sluggish to provide many encounters are ineffective. Wing dimorphism is apparently controlled by a diffusible `alata-determiner' liberated from the head of the parent. This agent seems partially to inhibit the secretory activity of the corpus allatum during the late prenatal and early postnatal periods of larval development. But the determination process, which decides the level of secretion, occupies only a few hours prior to birth.},

We conducted a genome-wide scan for long-lived balancing selection by looking for combinations of SNPs shared between humans and chimpanzees. In addition to the major histocompatibility complex, we identified 125 regions in which the same haplotypes are segregating in the two species, all but two of which are noncoding. In six cases, there is evidence for an ancestral polymorphism that persisted to the present in humans and chimpanzees. Regions with shared haplotypes are significantly enriched for membrane glycoproteins, and a similar trend is seen among shared coding polymorphisms. These findings indicate that ancient balancing selection has shaped human variation and point to genes involved in host-pathogen interactions as common targets.},

This paper will review how the spatial structure of biological populations and communities can be studied. We first demonstrate that many of the basic statistical methods used in ecological studies are impaired by autocorrelated data. Most if not all environmental data fall in this category. We will look briefly at ways of performing valid statistical tests in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. Methods now available for analysing the spatial structure of biological populations are described, and illustrated by vegetation data. These include various methods to test for the presence of spatial autocorrelation in the data: univariate methods (all-directional and two-dimensional spatial correlograms, and two-dimensional spectral analysis), and the multivariate Mantel test and Mantel correlogram; other descriptive methods of spatial structure: the univariate variogram, and the multivariate methods of clustering with spatial contiguity constraint; the partial Mantel test, presented here as a way of studying causal models that include space as an explanatory variable; and finally, various methods for mapping ecological variables and producing either univariate maps (interpolation, trend surface analysis, kriging) or maps of truly multivariate data (produced by constrained clustering). A table shows the methods classified in terms of the ecological questions they allow to resolve. Reference is made to available computer programs.},

We then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view, that each emphasizes different processes of potential importance in metacommunities. These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.},

  abstract = {Climate change can profoundly alter species' distributions due to changes in temperature, precipitation, or seasonality. Migratory monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) may be particularly susceptible to climate-driven changes in host plant abundance or reduced overwintering habitat. For example, climate change may significantly reduce the availability of overwintering habitat by restricting the amount of area with suitable microclimate conditions. However, potential effects of climate change on monarch northward migrations remain largely unknown, particularly with respect to their milkweed (Asclepias spp.) host plants. Given that monarchs largely depend on the genus Asclepias as larval host plants, the effects of climate change on monarch northward migrations will most likely be mediated by climate change effects on Asclepias. Here, I used MaxEnt species distribution modeling to assess potential changes in Asclepias and monarch distributions under moderate and severe climate change scenarios. First, Asclepias distributions were projected to extend northward throughout much of Canada despite considerable variability in the environmental drivers of each individual species. Second, Asclepias distributions were an important predictor of current monarch distributions, indicating that monarchs may be constrained as much by the availability of Asclepias host plants as environmental variables per se. Accordingly, modeling future distributions of monarchs, and indeed any tightly coupled plant-insect system, should incorporate the effects of climate change on host plant distributions. Finally, MaxEnt predictions of Asclepias and monarch distributions were remarkably consistent among general circulation models. Nearly all models predicted that the current monarch summer breeding range will become slightly less suitable for Asclepias and monarchs in the future. Asclepias, and consequently monarchs, should therefore undergo expanded northern range limits in summer months while encountering reduced habitat suitability throughout the northern migration.},

We based our choice of experimental numbers of mites on our finding that adult damselflies had between 0 and 12 mites (71\% had 0 mites), and mature adults had a higher prevalence and intensity of parasitism than did prereproductive damselflies in two of three field surveys. Low numbers of mites did not affect survivorship of teneral or mature males and females; however, high numbers of mites significantly depressed survivorship of teneral males and females and mature males, and were associated with a delay in maturation of females. Of teneral individuals, only females groomed more than controls when challenged with low numbers of mites; mature individuals of both sexes groomed more than controls in response to high numbers of mites but not in response to low numbers. Our results suggest that variation in grooming behaviour partially reflects variation in fitness costs, due to mite parasitism, across age and sex categories of hosts.},

The impact of the predator, Notonecta maculata, on invertebrate community structure was investigated by a combination of a natural pool survey, an outdoor artificial pool experiment, and a laboratory prey preference experiment. 2. In a survey of forty natural pools in the Negev Desert, Israel, pelagic/neustonic species richness and overall species richness, but not benthic species richness, were negatively associated with N. maculata density. 3. In the artificial pool experiment, in which the presence or absence of Notonecta was manipulated, Notonecta caused a reduction in the richness of species colonizing the pools. Notonecta strongly reduced densities of the pelagic dipterans, Culiseta longiareolata (often 100\% reduction of later-instar larvae and pupae) and ephydrids. Fewer Culiseta egg rafts were found in Notonecta pools, indicating that part of the observed reduction of Culiseta is not due to consumption of Culiseta larvae by Notonecta, but to habitat selection by ovipositing Culiseta females in response to risk of predation by Notonecta. Notonecta did not affect densities of (benthic) chironomids or the small cladoceran, Ceriodaphnia cf. quadrangula. Laboratory assessments of selectivity by Notonecta for the various prey matched patterns found in the field experiment. 4. This work provides strong evidence that N. maculata is an important organizer of community structure: it strongly reduces or even eliminates larger pelagic or neustonic species, but does not affect densities of small or benthic species.},

Farming of the sea is providing an increasing part of our fish supply. We are beginning to control atmospheric emissions. In 100 years, we shall use novel farming practices and genetic engineering of bacteria to manipulate the methane production of rice fields. The continental shelf will be providing food, energy, possibly even living space. To make such intensive management possible will require massive improvements in data collection and analysis, and especially in our concepts. A century hence we will live on a wired earth: the oceans and the crust of the earth will receive the same comprehensive monitoring now devoted to weather. As the peoples of currently developing countries increase their levels of wealth, the need for global management will become irresistible as impatience with the accidents of nature and intolerance of mismanagement of the environment - especially of living resources - grow. Our control of physical perturbations and chemical inputs to the environment will be judged by the consequences to living organisms and biological communities. How can we obtain the factual and theoretical foundation needed to move from our present, fragmented knowledge and limited abilities to a managed, global garden?" This problem was addressed in the lectures and workshops of a summer school on patch dynamics at Cornell University. The school emphasized the analysis and interpretation of spatial patterns in terrestrial and marine environments.

However, there are very few systems for which such broad datasets are available. One exception is the gram-negative bacterium, Helicobacter pylori, which infects upwards of 50\% of the global human population. This bacterium is associated with a wide breadth of human gastrointestinal disease, including numerous cancers, inflammatory disorders, and pathogenic infections, but is also known to confer fitness benefits to its host both indirectly, through interactions with other pathogens, and directly. Outstanding questions are therefore why, when, and how this bacterium transitions along the parasitism--mutualism continuum. We examine known virulence factors, genetic predispositions of the host, and environmental contributors that impact progression of clinical disease and help define geographical trends in disease incidence.

In recent years, biologists have increasingly integrated the effects of warming into their models by capturing how temperature shapes their physiology, ecology, behavior, evolutionary adaptation and probability of extirpation/extinction. The more physiologically-grounded approaches to predicting ectotherms' responses use thermal performance curves (TPCs) obtained by measuring species performance (e.g. growth rate) under different temperatures. TPCs are typically measured while other factors are held constant at benign levels to `isolate' the effects of temperature. Here we highlight that this practice paints a misleading picture because TPCs are functions of other factors, including global change stressors. We review evidence that resource limitation, pH, oxygen and CO2 concentration, salinity, water availability, parasites and mutualists, all influence TPC shape and thermal traits such as optimum temperature for growth. Evidence from a wide variety of organisms -- phytoplankton, protists, plants, insects and fish -- points towards such interactions increasing organisms' susceptibility to high temperatures (reducing it in the case of mutualists). Failing to account for these interactions is likely to lead to erroneous predictions of performance in nature and an underestimation of the risks of warming. We discuss the general patterns and possible consequences of such interactions for ecological communities. But importantly, interactions with TPCs share common features that we can learn from. Incorporating these interactions into population and community models should lead to deeper insights and more accurate predictions of species' performance in nature -- as well as strategies for managing natural and agricultural ecosystems in the face of warming.},

  abstract = {Urbanization results in habitat loss and habitat fragmentation concurrently, both influencing biodiversity and ecological processes. To evaluate these impacts, it is important to understand the relationships between habitat loss and habitat fragmentation per se (HLHF) during urbanization. The objectives of this study were two-fold: 1) to quantify the different forms of the HLHF relationship during urbanization using multiple landscape metrics, and 2) to test the validity of the HLHF relations reported in the literature. Our analysis was based on a long-term urbanization dataset (1800--2000) of 16 large cities from around the world. Habitat area was represented as the percentage of non-built-up area in the landscape, while habitat fragmentation was measured using several landscape metrics. Our results show that the relationship between habitat loss and habitat fragmentation during urbanization is commonly monotonic---linear, exponential, or logarithmic, indicating that the degree of habitat fragmentation per se increases with habitat loss in general. We compared our results with 14 hypothesized HLHF relationships based on simulated landscapes found in the literature, and found that four of them were consistent with those of urbanization, whereas the other ten were not. Also, we identified six new HLHF relationships when fragmentation was measured by total core area, normalized total core area, patch density, edge density and landscape shape index, respectively. In addition, our study demonstrated that the ``space-for-time'' approach, frequently used in ecology and geography, generated specious HLHF relationships, suggesting that this approach is largely inappropriate for analyses of urban landscapes that are highly heterogeneous in space and unusually contingent in dynamics. Our results show both generalities and idiosyncrasies of the HLHF relationship, providing new insights for assessing ecological effects of urbanization.},

  abstract = {Heterogeneity has a critical influence on biodiversity and ecosystem processes. While the influence of heterogeneity on species diversity and abundance is well documented, how heterogeneity influences the distribution and arrangement of necessary resources across a landscape is still unclear. Heterogeneity in vegetation structure and composition is often cited as an important factor in the near-ground thermal environment; however, because of a paucity of comparative studies across landscapes that differ in their degree of vegetation heterogeneity, researchers lack knowledge of the underlying mechanisms that influence variation in the thermal environment. Particularly, we do not have a clear understanding of the relative contribution of structural and compositional vegetation heterogeneity to thermal patterns. Therefore, we assessed the thermal environment in nine grassland landscapes that differed in their degree of structural and compositional heterogeneity. At the landscape level, we used a variance partitioning approach with linear mixed models to measure the link between four metrics of vegetation heterogeneity and temperature variability. At the microsite level, we used piecewise structural equation models to assess the fine-scale drivers of temperature in these landscapes and develop a causal model describing the relationship between vegetation variables and temperature. We found that temperature variance at the landscape scale was strongly related to the diversity of plant functional groups, heterogeneity in plant species composition, and variation in vegetation height. At finer scales, species richness, vegetation height, and overhead obstruction were the best predictors of temperature once weather was accounted for. Vegetation composition variables indirectly influenced fine-scale temperature variation through their effects on vegetation structure. These results suggest that scale has a strong influence on the observed relationship between temperature variance and different metrics of vegetation heterogeneity. Our results provide support for the role of landscape heterogeneity in shaping the thermal landscape and offer insights into the possible impacts of habitat homogenization on the thermal environment.},

Global prevalence across our metapopulations was less than half the observed within-patch prevalence, so that spatial structure alone afforded a great deal of protection to hosts against parasite infection. Our results showed further that migration played a determining role in occupancy, the number of patches infected within a metapopulation, while host population size played a determining role in local prevalence, the fraction of hosts infected within local patches. Local and global prevalence appeared to reach equilibrium levels on 2 different time-scales. Local host prevalence reached equilibrium values within 30 days of receiving an infected host migrant. Global prevalence increased more slowly and was clearly dependent upon occupancy, the number of host patches with at least 1 infected host, which in turn depended on the level of host migration among host patches. The effect of population size was not limited to local prevalence in patches without spatial structure but extended to sets of patches across the metapopulation. Lloyd's index of patchiness differed significantly between metapopulations with small versus large numbers of hosts. Although parasites were aggregated on hosts for both local patch sizes, they tended to aggregate to a much greater degree at the smaller host patch size. We discuss our empirical findings in light of current epidemiological theory.},

  abstract = {The potential consequences of biodiversity loss for ecosystem functioning and services at local scales have received considerable attention during the last decade, but little is known about how biodiversity affects ecosystem processes and stability at larger spatial scales. We propose that biodiversity provides spatial insurance for ecosystem functioning by virtue of spatial exchanges among local systems in heterogeneous landscapes. We explore this hypothesis by using a simple theoretical metacommunity model with explicit local consumer--resource dynamics and dispersal among systems. Our model shows that variation in dispersal rate affects the temporal mean and variability of ecosystem productivity strongly and nonmonotonically through two mechanisms: spatial averaging by the intermediate-type species that tends to dominate the landscape at high dispersal rates, and functional compensations between species that are made possible by the maintenance of species diversity. The spatial insurance effects of species diversity are highest at the intermediate dispersal rates that maximize local diversity. These results have profound implications for conservation and management. Knowledge of spatial processes across ecosystems is critical to predict the effects of landscape changes on both biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and services.},

Of the 133 papers published in 10 ecological journals between 1993 and 1995, 63 reported on field studies involving 299 and 103 successful, nonredundant plant and animal introductions, respectively. Invasions of terrestrial ecosystems dominated ({$>>$}97\%) the surveyed literature. Disturbance was associated with establishment of exotic species in 56\% of these studies, though its importance differed among papers describing plants (68\%) and animals (28\%). Plants species (86\%) were significantly more dependent on disturbance for establishment than were animals (12\%). However, animals and plants that were dependent on disturbance for establishment were almost equally dependent (58 versus 68\%) on it for range expansion. In a second survey, 402 plant and 103 animal taxa were identified that explicitly linked establishment of exotic species to disturbance. Human activities were attributed with establishment of species in 97 and 57\% of these cases, respectively. Common mechanisms associated with establishment of exotic animals included ballast water discharge, intentional releases, and residential development. Establishment of exotic plants was associated with animal activities (eg, grazing, seed introduction), soil disturbance, forestry, fire, agriculture, and human activities. In contrast to invasions theory, our survey indicates that the association between establishment and spread of exotic species and disturbance should not be assumed a priori. Some animals repeatedly invade new habitats once geographic barriers are circumvented, indicating that communities may be more receptive to exotic species than previously acknowledged. By contrast, introduced plants established most often in disturbed habitats.}

Surprisingly, estimates of this parameter (or equivalently, of the probability of dispersing successfully) are virtually absent from the literature. There are formidable difficulties in estimating dispersal risk by direct observation of emigrants, but we contend that many investigators have already collected demographic information that can be used to estimate it indirectly. The root problem is that the proportion of the population diat emigrates from its natal group or home range, e, is not generally observable. Nevertheless, for each value of e diere is only one possible survival rate of emigrants (st) and of philopatric animals (sf) diat can explain the overall survival rate. For study sites Uiat are neither sources nor sinks, we describe a graphical framework within which census data and behavioral observations can be used to place bounds on e, s, and sp. We use data from a Serengeti population of the dwarf mongoose (Helogale parvula) to illustrate how different types of data and assumptions allow us to construct better estimates of these parameters. For dwarf mongooses, die approach reveals unexpected differences in dispersal risk among sex and age classes},

Here, we investigate the independent effects of parasite exposure and infection on host metabolic rate. Our study focuses on Drosophila hydei and a naturally occurring ectoparasitic mite, Macrocheles muscaedomesticae. We use flow-through respirometry to measure the metabolic rate of flies during the period of exposure (preinfection) and during mite attachment. Flies were exposed to mites either indirectly (through a mesh screen) or directly, allowing for physical contact between the fly and the mite. We predicted that fly metabolic rate would increase with the level of parasite exposure: unexposed flies {$<$} flies with indirect exposure to mites {$<$} flies with direct contact with mites {$<$} flies actively infected with mites. As expected, flies indirectly exposed to but not in direct contact with mites produced 70\% more CO2 than unexposed flies. Flies in direct contact with mites produced 35\% more CO2 than flies with indirect contact, and this was more than double the amount of CO2 produced by unexposed flies. However, infected flies---those actually carrying mites---did not produce significantly more CO2 than uninfected flies. Our results show that simply being exposed to mites, either indirectly or directly, was sufficient to elicit a response from the host in terms of elevated CO2 production. Our results show that the costs of parasitism can potentially extend beyond the physiological costs of infection per se to include the energetic costs associated with parasite avoidance. Although studies have shown energetic costs associate with predator-avoidance behaviors, no study to our knowledge has measured the metabolic cost of parasite avoidance.},

Parasitism can impact a host's ability to perform energetically demanding activities such as long-distance flight, with important consequences for gene flow and meta-population dynamics. 2. Ectoparasites, in particular, can adversely affect host flight performance by diminishing flight aerodynamics and/or by inflicting physiological damage while feeding on host tissue. 3. Experimental flight assays were conducted using two fruit fly-mite systems: Drosophila nigrospiracula (Patterson and Wheeler) -- Macrocheles subbadius (Berlese) and D. hydei (Sturtevan) -- M. muscaedomesticae (Scopoli). Flies that are burdened by mites are expected to exhibit lower flight endurance compared to uninfected flies. 4. The results show that the presence of mites (attached) significantly decreased flight endurance by 57\% and 78\% compared to uninfected D. nigrospiracula and D. hydei, respectively. The physiological damage caused by M. subbadius was revealed through a 53\% decline in flight time among previously infected flies (mites removed just prior to flight assay). Surprisingly, the presumably phoretic M. muscaedomesticae also caused a 62\% reduction in flight endurance among previously infected D. hydei. 5. These results suggest a strong deleterious effect of ectoparasitic mites on host flight performance, mediated by a reduction in flight aerodynamics and damage to host physiology. Adverse effects on host flight and/or dispersal may have broad implications for gene flow, population genetic structure, and local adaptation in both host and parasite meta-populations.},

These mutualists may influence one another through direct interference or indirectly by competing for shared reward resources or through alteration of plant traits. Together, these mutualists also may combine to affect plant hosts in ways that may not be predictable based on pairwise interactions. Given that the outcome of mutualistic interactions often depends on environmental conditions, multi-mutualist effects on one another, and their plant hosts may be affected by global changes. Here, we grew focal plants under simulated global warming conditions and manipulated the presence of partner mutualists to test how warming affects the outcome of interactions between focal plants and their partners (nitrogen-fixing rhizobia, ant defenders, and pollinators) and interactions among these partner mutualists. We find that warming alters the fitness benefits plants receive from rhizobium resource mutualists but not ant mutualists and that warming altered plant investment in all mutualists. We also find that mutualist partners interact, often by altering the availability of plant-produced rewards that facilitate interactions with other partners. Our work illustrates that global changes may affect some but not all mutualisms, often asymmetrically (e.g., affecting investment in the mutualist partner but not plant host benefits) and also highlights the ubiquity of interactions between the multiple mutualists associating with a shared host.},

Any technical assessment, monitoring program or scientific research applying citizen science data should therefore include an evaluation of the uncertainty of its results. We use `ignorance' scores, i.e. spatially explicit indices of sampling bias across a study region, to further understand spatial patterns of observation behaviour for 13 reference taxonomic groups. The data is based on voluntary observations made in Sweden between 2000 and 2014. We compared the effect of six geographical variables (elevation, steepness, population density, log population density, road density and footpath density) on the ignorance scores of each group. We found substantial variation among taxonomic groups in the relative importance of different geographic variables for explaining ignorance scores. In general, road access and logged population density were consistently important variables explaining bias in sampling effort, indicating that access at a landscape-scale facilitates voluntary reporting by citizen scientists. Also, small increases in population density can produce a substantial reduction in ignorance score. However the between-taxa variation in the importance of geographic variables for explaining ignorance scores demonstrated that different taxa suffer from different spatial biases. We suggest that conservationists and researchers should use ignorance scores to acknowledge uncertainty in their analyses and conclusions, because they may simultaneously include many correlated variables that are difficult to disentangle.},

  abstract = {Particularly interesting cases of mutualistic endosymbioses come from the establishment of co-obligate associations of more than one species of endosymbiotic bacteria. Throughout symbiotic accommodation from a free-living bacterium, passing through a facultative stage and ending as an obligate intracellular one, the symbiont experiences massive genomic losses and phenotypic adjustments. Here, we scrutinized the changes in the coevolution of Serratia symbiotica and Buchnera aphidicola endosymbionts in aphids, paying particular attention to the transformations undergone by S. symbiotica to become an obligate endosymbiont. Although it is already known that S. symbiotica is facultative in Acyrthosiphon pisum, in Cinara cedri it has established a co-obligate endosymbiotic consortium along with B. aphidicola to fulfill the aphid's nutritional requirements. The state of this association in C. tujafilina, an aphid belonging to the same subfamily (Lachninae) that C. cedri, remained unknown. Here, we report the genome of S. symbiotica strain SCt-VLC from the aphid C. tujafilina. While being phylogenetically and genomically very closely related to the facultative endosymbiont S. symbiotica from the aphid A. pisum, it shows a variety of metabolic, genetic, and architectural features, which point toward this endosymbiont being one step closer to an obligate intracellular one. We also describe in depth the process of genome rearrangements suffered by S. symbiotica and the role mobile elements play in gene inactivations. Finally, we postulate the supply to the host of the essential riboflavin (vitamin B2) as key to the establishment of S. symbiotica as a co-obligate endosymbiont in the aphids belonging to the subfamily Lachninane.},

  abstract = {Genome reduction is pervasive among maternally-inherited endosymbiotic organisms, from bacteriocyte- to gut-associated ones. This genome erosion is a step-wise process in which once free-living organisms evolve to become obligate associates, thereby losing non-essential or redundant genes/functions. Serratia symbiotica (Gammaproteobacteria), a secondary endosymbiont present in many aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae), displays various characteristics that make it a good model organism for studying genome reduction. While some strains are of facultative nature, others have established co-obligate associations with their respective aphid host and its primary endosymbiont (Buchnera). Furthermore, the different strains hold genomes of contrasting sizes and features, and have strikingly disparate cell shapes, sizes, and tissue tropism. Finally, genomes from closely related free-living Serratia marcescens are also available. In this study, we describe in detail the genome reduction process (from free-living to reduced obligate endosymbiont) undergone by S. symbiotica, and relate it to the stages of integration to the symbiotic system the different strains find themselves in. We establish that the genome reduction patterns observed in S. symbiotica follow those from other dwindling genomes, thus proving to be a good model for the study of the genome reduction process within a single bacterial taxon evolving in a similar biological niche (aphid-Buchnera).},

Here, we use distribution data for over 600 species of arthropods collected over 150 years from locations across Italy and test how multiple environmental stressors (climate, land use and human population density) influenced assemblage composition and functionality. By carefully reconstructing the temporal changes in these stressors, we explicitly tested how environmental changes can determine the observed changes in taxonomic and functional diversity. We found that rapid changes in precipitation destabilize the assemblages and maximize colonization and extinction rates, especially when coupled with changes in human population density (for taxonomy) or temperature (for functionality). Higher microclimatic heterogeneity increases the stability of biodiversity by reducing taxonomic and functional loss. Finally, changes in natural habitats increased colonization, influencing taxonomic nestedness and functional replacement. The integration of long-term datasets combining distributions, climate and traits may deepen our understanding of the processes underlying biodiversity responses to global-scale drivers.},

Density effects of the aposematic oleander aphid, Aphis nerii, on cardenolide expression were measured in two milkweed species, Asclepias curassavica and A. incarnata. These plants vary in constitutive chemical investment with high mean cardenolide concentration in A. curassavica and low to zero in A. incarnata. The second objective was toDetermine whether cardenolide expression in these two host plants impacts mean A. nerii colony biomass (mg) andDensity. Cardenolide concentration ({$\mu$}g/g) of A. curassavica in both aphid-treated leaves and opposite, herbivore-free leavesDecreased initially in comparison with aphid-free controls, and then increased significantly with A. neriiDensity. Thus, A. curassavica responds to aphid herbivory initially withDensity-dependent phytochemical reduction, followed by induction of cardenolides to concentrations above aphid-free controls. In addition, mean cardenolide concentration of aphid-treated leaves was significantly higher than that of opposite, herbivore-free leaves. Therefore, A. curassavica induction is strongest in herbivore-damaged tissue. Conversely, A. incarnata exhibited no such chemical response to aphid herbivory. Furthermore, neither host plant responded chemically to herbivore feeding duration time (days) or to the interaction between herbivore initialDensity and feeding duration time. There were also no significant differences in mean colony biomass or populationDensity of A. nerii reared on high cardenolide (A. curassavica) and low cardenolide (A. incarnata) hosts.},

In particular, the presence of mutualistic symbionts at the leading edge of a host-symbiont community should enhance its propagation in space. We develop a theoretical framework that captures the eco-evolutionary dynamics of host-symbiont communities, to investigate how the evolution of resource exchange may shape community structure during range expansion. We consider a community which includes symbionts that are mutualistic or parasitic to various degrees, where parasitic symbionts receive the same amount of resource from the host as mutualistic symbionts, but at lower cost. The selective advantage of parasitic over mutualistic symbionts is strengthened with resource availability (i.e. with host density), promoting mutualism at the range edges, where host density is low, and parasitism in the population core, where host density is higher. This spatial selection also influences the speed of spread. We find that the host growth rate (which depends on the average benefit provided by the symbionts) is maximal at the range edges, where symbionts are more mutualistic, and that host-symbiont communities with high symbiont density at their core (e.g. resulting from more mutualistic hosts) spread faster into new territories. These results indicate that the expansion of host-symbiont communities is pulled by the hosts but pushed by the symbionts, in a unique push-pull dynamics of which both, host and symbionts, are active and tightly-linked players.

In sessile plant pathosystems, the spread of a pathogen highly depends on the movement and mobility of the vector. However, questions remain as to whether and how pathogen-induced vector manipulations may affect the spread of a plant pathogen. Here we report for the first time that infection with a bacterial plant pathogen increases the probability of vector dispersal, and that such movement of vectors is likely manipulated by a bacterial plant pathogen. We investigated how Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas) affects dispersal behavior, flight capacity, and the sexual attraction of its vector, the Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri Kuwayama). CLas is the putative causal agent of huanglongbing (HLB), which is a disease that threatens the viability of commercial citrus production worldwide. When D. citri developed on CLas-infected plants, short distance dispersal of male D. citri was greater compared to counterparts reared on uninfected plants. Flight by CLas-infected D. citri was initiated earlier and long flight events were more common than by uninfected psyllids, as measured by a flight mill apparatus. Additionally, CLas titers were higher among psyllids that performed long flights than psyllid that performed short flights. Finally, attractiveness of female D. citri that developed on infected plants to male conspecifics increased proportionally with increasing CLas bacterial titers measured within female psyllids. Our study indicates that the phytopathogen, CLas, may manipulate movement and mate selection behavior of their vectors, which is a possible evolved mechanism to promote their own spread. These results have global implications for both current HLB models of disease spread and control strategies.},

  abstract = {The populations of many North American forest-breeding songbirds have declined over the past few decades, initiating much research regarding the factors influencing avian use of remaining forests, many of which are highly disturbed and impacted by invasive plants. Our objective was to compare the species richness of breeding birds in riparian forest fragments that contain different amounts of the invasive shrub, Rosa multiflora (Multiflora Rose). We conducted 20 point counts in each of three sites from early June until mid-July of 2008 and 2009, and estimated species richness and relative richness using the program COMDYN4. During 2008, species richness was lower at the site with the most Multiflora Rose. However, the number of species at that site increased by 33\% from 2008 to 2009, whereas the number of species in the other two sites remained similar. Consequently, we did not detect differences in species richness among sites during 2009. Despite the increase in species richness at the more heavily invaded site, several common ground- to shrub-nesting species did not occur at that site during either year. Multiflora Rose may reduce the species richness of breeding birds in forest fragments, but additional research coinciding with the control and removal of this invasive shrub will be needed to infer such a relationship.}

Acknowledging their variability and evolution has allowed us to understand how species adapt in response to their environment. The same traits are also involved in how species alter ecosystems and shape their dynamics and functioning. Some theories, such as the metabolic theory of ecology, ecological stoichiometry or pace-of-life theory, already recognize this junction, but only do so in an implicitly non-spatial context. Meanwhile, for a decade now, it has been argued that ecosystem properties have to be understood at a larger scale using meta-ecosystem theory because source--sink dynamics, community assembly and ecosystem stability are all modified by spatial structure. Here, we argue that some ecosystem properties can be linked to a single life-history trait, dispersal, i.e. the tendency of organisms to live, compete and reproduce away from their birth place. By articulating recent theoretical and empirical studies linking ecosystem functioning and dynamics to species dispersal, we aim to highlight both the known connections between life-history traits and ecosystem properties and the unknown areas, which deserve further empirical and theoretical developments.},

In many animals, dispersal behaviour is plastic, but how organisms with plastic dispersal respond to climate change is basically unknown. Here, we report the analysis of interannual dispersal change from 16 years of monitoring a wild population of the common lizard, and a 12-year manipulation of lizards' diet intended to disentangle the direct effect of temperature rise on dispersal from its effects on resource availability. We show that juvenile dispersal has declined dramatically over the last 16 years, paralleling the rise of spring temperatures during embryogenesis. A mesoscale model of metapopulation dynamics predicts that in general dispersal inhibition will elevate the extinction risk of metapopulations exposed to contrasting effects of climate warming.},

  abstract = {The nonconsumptive effects (NCEs) of predators on prey behavior and physiology can influence the structure and function of ecological communities. However, the strength of NCEs should depend on the physiological and environmental contexts in which prey must choose between food and safety. For ectotherms, temperature effects on metabolism and foraging rates may shape these choices, thereby altering NCE strength. We examined NCEs in a rocky intertidal food chain across a latitudinal sea surface temperature gradient within the Gulf of Maine. The NCEs of green crabs (Carcinus maenas) on the foraging, growth, and growth efficiency of prey snails (Nucella lapillus) were consistent across a broad ({\textasciitilde}8.5~{$^\circ$}C) temperature range, even though snails that were transplanted south consumed twice as many mussels (Mytilus edulis) and grew twice as much as snails that were transplanted north. The positive effects of warmer temperatures in the south allowed snails under high risk to perform similarly to or better than snails under low risk at cooler temperatures. Our results suggest that for prey populations residing at temperatures below their thermal optimum, the positive effects of future warming may offset the negative effects of predation risk. Such effects may be favorable to prey populations facing increased predation rates due to warmer temperatures associated with climate change. Attention to the direct and indirect effects of temperature on species interactions should improve our ability to predict the effects of climate change on ecological communities.},

  abstract = {Animal mortality caused by vehicle collisions is one of the main ecological impacts of roads. Amphibians are the most affected group and road fatalities have a significant impact on population dynamics and viability. Several studies on Iberian amphibians have shown the importance of country roads on amphibian road mortality, but still, little is known about the situation in northern Portugal. By being more permeable to amphibian passage, country roads represent a greater source of mortality than highways, which act as barriers. Thus, mitigation measures should be applied, but due to the extensive road network, the identification of precise locations (hotspots) and variables related to animal-vehicle collision is needed to plan these measures successfully. The aim of the study was to analyse the spatial occurrence and related factors linked to amphibian mortality on a number of country roads in northern Portugal, using spatial statistics implemented in GIS and applying a binary logistical regression. We surveyed 631 km of road corresponding to seven transects, and observed 404 individual amphibians: 74 (18.3\%) alive and 330 (81.7\%) road-killed. Bufo bufo represented 80\% of the mortality records. Three transects showed clustered distribution of road-kills, and broadleaved forests and road ditches were the most important factors associated with hotspots of road-kill. Logistic regression models showed that habitat quality, Bufo bufo's habitat preferences, and road ditches are positively associated with amphibians' road mortality in northern Portugal, whereas average altitude and length of walls were negatively associated. This study is a useful tool to understand spatial occurrence of amphibian road-kills in the face of applying mitigation measures on country roads from northern Portugal. This study also considers the necessity of assessing the condition of amphibian local populations to understand their road-kills spatial patterns and the urgency to apply mitigation measures on country roads.},

Forty-eight treatment combinations of fixed placement levels for eggs (top, middle, bottom, and random) and larvae (top, middle, and bottom) were tested for each strain in three replicates. Following a 24-h treatment exposure period, measurements of egg cannibalism and larval position revealed that + larvae tended to disperse toward the bottom regardless of original placement position or egg type, while ap larvae tended to remain near the original placement position. Overall larval dispersal was affected by egg position. Egg cannibalism rate was higher for + larvae than ap larvae, and some degree of ap egg preference was exhibited by + larvae.

The model is intended to represent a warm---blooded vertebrate predator and its prey. The main conclusions are: (1) Coexistence of predator and prey is possible, but if so, the number of prey present will not be substantially below the equilibrium number in the absence of predators. Mutual regulation of predator and prey, with the latter substantially below the carrying capacity of the environment, is unstable. (2) Coexistence is more likely if there are differences in hunting ability between different individual predators--for example, between young and old predators. (3) Cover for the prey enables the prey species to survive the extinction of the predator, but does not make coexistence more likely.},

If current estimates of amphibian species in imminent danger of extinction are included in these calculations, then the current amphibian extinction rate may range from 25,039--45,474 times the background extinction rate for amphibians.

Asia's rhinos persist in remnant, ecologically extinct populations and the most threatened of these is the Sumatran rhino, Dicerorhinus sumatrensis. To understand the seed dispersal role of Sumatran rhinos, we consolidated information on fruit consumption, seed dispersal, and fruit traits from a 2-month field study (Sumatra), local ecological knowledge (Peninsular Malaysia), and published and unpublished accounts. We evaluated differences between the taxa and traits of fruits dispersed by rhinos and elephants, and identified other dispersers of megafaunal-syndrome fruits that were rhino-dispersed. At least 79 plant species were dispersed by rhinos: overstorey plants (trees and climbers; 78\% of species) had large, usually ``mammal-colored,'' fruits and seeds, and were mainly drupes and berries; 61\% of these were megafaunal-syndrome fruits ({$>$}4 cm wide). Understorey plants (herbs, shrubs, and small trees) had small, often capsular, fruits and seeds that are potentially dispersed following the ``foliage-is-the-fruit'' hypothesis. Rhinos were the only known disperser for 35\% of the megafaunal-fruit genera. The highest dispersal overlap shown was with elephants: fruits dispersed by rhinos tended to be capsular and were smaller than fruits dispersed by both elephants and rhinos. Given these findings and the different foraging and ranging behavior of Sumatran rhinos and elephants, we suggest that these megafauna had important differences in their seed dispersal roles. Asian rainforests have, therefore, lost an important seed dispersal mutualist. Conservation efforts should aim to protect and restore the ecological function of these unique creatures.

Identifying which species are more often hit by vehicles and which landscape and road-related features promote roadkill is essential to guide future development and ensure adequate mitigation actions. For six months, we monitored 240~km of roads in the Ecuadorian Amazon and recorded 1125 dead vertebrates (149 species). Reptiles were the most observed Class with 380 individuals (56 species), followed by amphibians with 278 individuals (11 species), birds with 259 individuals (62 species), and mammals with 208 individuals (20 species). We used Random Forest models to explore the role of various land cover types and road sinuosity on the observed mortality. Additionally, we created heatmaps to visualize the road segments where roadkills were more frequent. For all vertebrates, mortality was more likely in straight road sections near rivers. The effects of other variables were taxa-specific. Amphibian mortality was more likely near bare soil or forest, birds and mammals died more often near herbaceous-shrubby vegetation, and reptile mortality occurred more often in areas with high cover of agriculture. Road segments with high mortality (i.e., roadkill hotspots) varied across taxa. These hotspots identify areas where further research into mitigation is needed to assess road impacts and prevent collisions. Among records, we found rare and threatened species, for which road mortality could be a significant threat. Roadkill surveys not only aid in quantifying threats and informing future planning but can also provide insight into local biodiversity.},

Model predictions were generally supported by a global data set on invertebrate abundance that was amassed during the International Biological Programme, indicating that fundamental energetic principles explain a large degree of variation in invertebrate abundance across the globe.},

Right from the egg to larval and adult stages, insects must deal with a great biodiversity of natural enemies and mutualists. Such relationships evolved for millions of years in such a way that aquatic insects developed behavioral, ecological, and evolutionary strategies to cope with predation, parasitism, and competition. In the same way, they have joined forces with other organisms to solve problems, such as the interaction with gut bacteria to digest cellulose. These strategies and selective forces not only predict behavior and occurrence of aquatic insects, but also shape their diversity, community structures, and population dynamics. In this chapter, we sought to bring to the reader a useful source of information and a background for future studies. Although our current knowledge on species interactions in freshwater habitats allows us to discuss several topics, there is an open field of possibilities and gaps to be addressed in future research.},

The LULC change has a significant influence on the quality of natural habitat and ecosystem functions. The study assessed and modeled the habitat quality of the Kaffa biosphere reserve using the ``Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs'' (InVEST) model. The InVEST model helps to evaluate the impacts of landscape changes on the quality of habitats in combination with habitat-threatening factors. The mean values of the habitat quality indices in 1986, 1999, 2009, and 2019 were 0.80, 0.77, 0.67, and 0.65, respectively. Furthermore, the habitat quality for the years 2034 and 2049 would decrease continuously to 0.61 and 0.60, respectively. Settlement and agricultural areas have a lower habitat quality index compared to the other native habitats. This confirms the expansion of human-modified landscapes such as settlement and agricultural lands in the biosphere reserve, which, in turn, caused degrading the habitat quality of the biosphere reserve. The spatial metrics of patch number, patch density, the largest patch index, and the area mean index showed the prevalence of forest fragmentation. This, in turn, has worsened the overall habitat quality of the biosphere reserve. In addition, the result of the binary logistic regression indicated that the expansion of settlement areas in the biosphere reserve was a significant influencing factor on the habitat quality. Overall, the study results confirmed that the biosphere reserve has both spatial and temporal variability of habitat quality. Therefore, evaluating and predicting the spatiotemporal status of habitat quality under the influence of LULC change can offer a scientific basis for developing strategies for biodiversity conservation and landscape planning.},

  abstract = {Whereas prey are known to avoid habitats with their predators, it is less well established whether they are triggered to emigrate to new habitats when exposed to predators in their current habitat. We studied plant-to-plant dispersal of adult whiteflies in response to the presence of predatory mites on the plant on which the whiteflies were released. These predators attack whitefly eggs and crawlers, but not the adults, which can fly to other plants and can learn to avoid plants with predators. Being tiny and wingless, the predatory mites are slow dispersers compared to adult whiteflies. This offers the whiteflies the opportunity to escape from plants with predatory mites to plants without predators, thus avoiding predation of their offspring. To test for this escape response, a greenhouse experiment was carried out, where whiteflies were released on the first of a row of 5 cucumber plants, 0.6 m or 2 m apart, and predators either on the same plant, on the next plant, or nowhere (control). Adult whiteflies dispersed significantly faster from plants with predatory mites onto neighbouring plants when the plants were 0.6 m apart, but not when plants were 2 m apart. However, the final numbers of whiteflies that had successfully dispersed at the end of the experiments did not differ significantly for either of the two interplant distances. Overall, the proportion of whiteflies that did disperse was low, suggesting that adult whiteflies were apparently reluctant to disperse, even from plants with predators. Our results suggest that this reluctance increases with the distance between the plants, so most likely depends on the uncertainty to find a new plant. Thus, whiteflies do not always venture to fly even when they can easily bridge the distance to another plant.},

  abstract = {Range expansion results from complex eco-evolutionary processes where range dynamics and niche shifts interact in a novel physical space and/or environment, with scale playing a major role. Obligate symbionts (i.e. organisms permanently living on hosts) differ from free-living organisms in that they depend on strong biotic interactions with their hosts which alter their niche and spatial dynamics. A symbiotic lifestyle modifies organism--environment relationships across levels of organisation, from individuals to geographical ranges. These changes influence how symbionts experience colonisation and, by extension, range expansion. Here, we investigate the potential implications of a symbiotic lifestyle on range expansion capacity. We present a unified conceptual overview on range expansion of symbionts that integrates concepts grounded in niche and metapopulation theories. Overall, we explain how niche-driven and dispersal-driven processes govern symbiont range dynamics through their interaction across scales, from host switching to geographical range shifts. First, we describe a background framework for range dynamics based on metapopulation concepts applied to symbiont organisation levels. Then, we integrate metapopulation processes operating in the physical space with niche dynamics grounded in the environmental arena. For this purpose, we provide a definition of the biotope (i.e. living place) specific to symbionts as a hinge concept to link the physical and environmental spaces, wherein the biotope unit is a metapopulation patch (either a host individual or a land fragment). Further, we highlight the dual nature of the symbionts' niche, which is characterised by both host traits and the external environment, and define proper conceptual variants to provide a meaningful unification of niche, biotope and symbiont organisation levels. We also explore variation across systems in the relative relevance of both external environment and host traits to the symbiont's niche and their potential implications on range expansion. We describe in detail the potential mechanisms by which hosts, through their function as biotopes, could influence how some symbionts expand their range -- depending on the life history and traits of both associates. From the spatial point of view, hosts can extend symbiont dispersal range via host-mediated dispersal, although the requirement for among-host dispersal can challenge symbiont range expansion. From the niche point of view, homeostatic properties of host bodies may allow symbiont populations to become insensitive to off-host environmental gradients during host-mediated dispersal. These two potential benefits of the symbiont--host interaction can enhance symbiont range expansion capacity. On the other hand, the central role of hosts governing the symbiont niche makes symbionts strongly dependent on the availability of suitable hosts. Thus, environmental, dispersal and biotic barriers faced by suitable hosts apply also to the symbiont, unless eventual opportunities for host switching allow the symbiont to expand its repertoire of suitable hosts (thus expanding its fundamental niche). Finally, symbionts can also improve their range expansion capacity through their impacts on hosts, via protecting their affiliated hosts from environmental harshness through biotic facilitation.},

Approaches derived from different genetic disciplines are extending the theoretical and applied frameworks on which ecological restoration is based. We performed a search of scientific articles and identified 160 articles that employed a genetic approach within a restoration context to shed light on the links between genetics and restoration. These articles were then classified on whether they examined association between genetics and fitness or the application of genetics in demographic studies, and on the way the studies informed restoration practice. Although genetic research in restoration is rapidly growing, we found that studies could make better use of the extensive toolbox developed by applied fields in genetics. Overall, 41\% of reviewed studies used genetic information to evaluate or monitor restoration, and 59\% provided genetic information to guide prerestoration decision-making processes. Reviewed studies suggest that restoration practitioners often overlook the importance of including genetic aspects within their restoration goals. Even though there is a genetic basis influencing the provision of ecosystem services, few studies explored this relationship. We provide a view of research gaps, future directions and challenges in the genetics of restoration.},

Tracking this movement in the field is difficult, with mass migrations often occurring at high altitudes and over large spatial scales. 2. As such, tethered flight provides a valuable tool for studying the flight behaviour of insects, giving insights into flight propensity (e.g. distance, duration and velocity) and orientation under controlled laboratory settings. By experimentally manipulating a variety of environmental and physiological traits, numerous studies have used this technology to study the flight behaviour of migratory insects ranging in size from aphids to butterflies. Advances in functional genomics promise to extend this to the identification of genetic factors associated with flight. Tethered flight techniques have been used to study migratory flight characteristics in insects for more than 50 years, but have never been reviewed. 3. This study summarises the key findings of this technology, which has been employed in studies of species from six Orders. By providing detailed descriptions of the tethered flight systems, the present study also aims to further the understanding of how tethered flight studies support field observations, the situations under which the technology is useful and how it might be used in future studies. 4. The aim is to contextualise the available tethered flight studies within the broader knowledge of insect migration and to describe the significant contribution these systems have made to the literature.},

Predictive models remain elusive due to the complexity of host--parasite systems and insufficient data describing how environmental conditions affect various system components. Here, we link host--macroparasite models with the Metabolic Theory of Ecology, providing a mechanistic framework that allows integrating multiple nonlinear environmental effects to estimate parasite fitness under novel conditions. The models allow determining the fundamental thermal niche of a parasite, and thus, whether climate change leads to range contraction or may permit a range expansion. Applying the models to seasonal environments, and using an arctic nematode with an endotherm host for illustration, we show that climate warming can split a continuous spring-to-fall transmission season into two separate transmission seasons with altered timings. Although the models are strategic and most suitable to evaluate broad-scale patterns of climate change impacts, close correspondence between model predictions and empirical data indicates model applicability also at the species level. As the application of Metabolic Theory considerably aids the a priori estimation of model parameters, even in data-sparse systems, we suggest that the presented approach could provide a framework for understanding and predicting climatic impacts for many host--parasite systems worldwide.},

Aphids infected artificially with PASS, however, were able to produce up to 48\% of the normal complement of offspring produced by PASS-positive aphids that had not been heat-stressed. Clones infected artificially with PAR did not have the same advantage as those with PASS after heat stress. 4. In aphids without PASS or PAR, heat stress reduced the number of bacteriocytes (in which the obligate primary symbiont, Buchnera, resides) to 7\% of non-heat-stressed aphids, while aphids with only PASS retained 70\% of their bacteriocytes. Bacteriocytes in aphids with PAR but not PASS were reduced to 42\% of controls. 5. When larvae were heat-stressed as older instars (5 days old), a similar pattern emerged, though the effect of heat stress was less extreme. Clones containing PASS produced the most offspring, three to 14 times as many as aphids without PASS or PAR. Aphids with PAR only, or PASS and PAR together, had reduced or no advantage over aphids without facultative symbionts. 6. Aphids of all clones that had been heat-stressed as later instars gave birth to a variable number of stillborn offspring. Aphids without facultative symbionts produced the most stillborn larvae. 7.

It is the first study to demonstrate in both the laboratory and the field that parasites may produce behaviorally dimorphic prey populations with respect to definitive host foraging patterns. Differences in the prevalence of such parasites could influence the outcomes of a variety of field studies involving foraging because encounter rates in such situations may not uniformly reflect prey abundances. My experiments showed that infected A. vulgare do not behave like uninfected conspecifics. In laboratory tests, infected animals were found more frequently in less humid areas, on light---colored substrate, and in unsheltered areas. Infected females rested less often and moved farther. They did not develop ovaries and did not grow as rapidly as control females. Nestling Starlings in the field had a higher P. cylindraceus prevalence than that expected if parents had foraged on isopods without respect to infection. In the laboratory, adult Starlings consumed more infected than uninfected isopods when presented with the same number of each. This foraging preference is probably because of increased encounters with infected isopods, which apparently frequent more exposed areas than do uninfected conspecifics.},

Parasite-defence grooming is regulated both by a central control mechanism (programmed grooming model) and by cutaneous stimulation from bites (stimulus-driven model). To study the evolution of parasite-defence grooming in ungulates, we compared species-typical grooming behaviour with host morphology and habitat to test predictions of the programmed grooming model while taking into account phylogenetic relatedness. We observed grooming in 60 ungulate species at ectoparasite-free zoological parks in which the confound of differential tick exposure was controlled for and stimulus-driven grooming was ruled out. Concentrated-changes tests indicated that sexually dimorphic grooming (in which breeding males groom less than females) has coevolved with sexual body size dimorphism, suggesting that intrasexual selection has favoured reduced grooming that enhances vigilance of males for oestrous females and rival males. Concentrated-changes tests also revealed that the evolution of complex oral grooming (involving alternate use of both teeth and tongue) and adult allogrooming (whereby conspecifics oral groom body regions not accessible by self grooming) was concentrated in lineages inhabiting closed woodland or forest habitat associated with increased tick exposure, with such advanced grooming being most concentrated in Cervidae. Regression analyses of independent contrasts indicated that both host body size and habitat play a role in the evolution of species-typical oral grooming rates, as previously reported. These results indicate that the observed grooming represents centrally driven grooming patterns favoured by natural selection in each lineage. This is the first phylogenetically controlled comparative study to report the evolution of parasite-defence grooming behaviours in response to selection pressures predicted by the programmed grooming hypothesis.},

This geographic reshuffling may result in novel co-occurrences among species, which could lead to unseen biotic interactions, including the exchange of parasites between previously isolated hosts. Identifying potential new host--parasite interactions would improve forecasting of disease emergence and inform proactive disease surveillance. However, accurate predictions of future cross-species disease transmission have been hampered by the lack of a generalized approach and data availability. Here, we propose a framework to predict novel host--parasite interactions based on a combination of niche modelling of future host distributions and parasite sharing models. Using the North American ungulates as a proof of concept, we show this approach has high cross-validation accuracy in over 85\% of modelled parasites and find that more than 34\% of the host--parasite associations forecasted by our models have already been recorded in the literature. We discuss potential sources of uncertainty and bias that may affect our results and similar forecasting approaches, and propose pathways to generate increasingly accurate predictions. Our results indicate that forecasting parasite sharing in response to shifts in host geographic distributions allow for the identification of regions and taxa most susceptible to emergent pathogens under climate change.

  abstract = {The topology of plant--animal mutualistic networks has the potential to determine the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of interacting species. Many mechanisms have been proposed as explanations of observed network patterns; however, the fact that plant--animal interactions are inherently spatial has so far been ignored. Using a simulation model of frugivorous birds foraging in spatially explicit landscapes we evaluated how plant distribution and the scale of bird movement decisions influenced species interaction probabilities and the resulting network properties. Spatial aggregation and limited animal mobility restricted encounter probabilities, so that the distribution of animal visits per plant deviated strongly from the binomial distribution expected for a well-mixed system. Lack of mixing in turn resulted in a strong decrease in network connectance, a weak decrease in nestedness, stronger interactions, greater strength asymmetry and the unexpected presence/absence of some interactions. Our results suggest that spatial processes may contribute substantially to structure plant--animal mutualistic networks.},

  abstract = {Beech bark disease (BBD) is an insect--fungus complex involving the beech scale insect (Cryptococcus fagisuga Lind.) and one of two canker fungi. Beech scale was introduced to Halifax, Nova Scotia around 1890, presumably with the fungus Neonectria coccinea var. faginata Lohm. The disease has subsequently spread through a large portion of the range of beech. We used historical maps of the extent of the advancing BBD front (defined by presence of scale insects) in North America to estimate its rate of spread as 14.7~{\textpm} 0.9~km/year. This estimate did not account for stochastic ``jumps'' by the scale insects to several disjunct locations; therefore, this rate is a conservative estimate. Comparison of the year of scale colonization with beech density did not suggest a relationship between the scale spread rate and beech density. Our analyses also indicated that BBD has invaded less than 30\% of regions where beech is present, but it has invaded most of the regions where beech is a dominant component of stands. Despite regional increases in beech mortality following invasion, considerable amounts of live beech remain in invaded areas. Moreover, the volume of beech has increased in most areas, though generally at lower rates than that observed for associated tree species.},

Although the conditions of local and regional coexistence have been well defined in such systems, no study has attempted to provide clear predictions of classical community-wide patterns. Here we provide predictions for species richness, species relative abundances, and community-level functional properties (productivity and space occupation) at the local and regional scales as functions of the proportion of dispersal between communities. Local ({$\alpha$}) diversity is maximal at an intermediate level of dispersal, whereas between-community ({$\beta$}) and regional ({$\gamma$}) diversity decline as dispersal increases because of increased homogenization of the metacommunity. The relationships between local and regional species richness and the species rank abundance distributions are strongly affected by the level of dispersal. Local productivity and space occupation tend to decline as dispersal increases, resulting in either a hump-shaped or a positive relationship between species richness and productivity, depending on the scale considered (local or regional). These effects of dispersal are buffered by decreasing species dispersal success. Our results provide a niche-based alternative to the recent neutral-metacommunity model and have important implications for conservation biology and landscape management.},

The evidence to support this theory is reviewed and the ecological and evolutionary significance of the findings is discussed. 2. The common assertion of poor host-plant nutritional quality leading to increased production of winged morphs does not always apply, particularly when the host-plant quality is exceptionally poor. The available data are skewed heavily towards Myzus persicae, and for this species the dynamical change in plant quality appears to be important with respect to wing induction. 3. Crowding may be a less influential stimulus for wing induction as study methods approach natural conditions experienced by aphids on their host plant. 4. The growing evidence that interactions with other organisms can induce the production of winged morphs by aphid colonies is reviewed. In the case of natural enemies, such a response by an aphid colony may be regarded as induced defence. Wing induction may also act as a means of transmission for a virus or fungal pathogen.},

  abstract = {In spite of growing reliance on translocations in wildlife conservation, translocation efficacy remains inconsistent. One factor that can contribute to failed translocations is releasing animals into poor-quality or otherwise inadequate habitat. Here, we used a targeted approach to test the relationship of habitat features to post-translocation dispersal and survival of juvenile Mojave desert tortoises Gopherus agassizii. We selected three habitat characteristics -- rodent burrows, substrate texture (prevalence and size of rocks) and washes (ephemeral river beds) -- that are tied to desert tortoise ecology. At the point of release, we documented rodent burrow abundance, substrate texture and wash presence and analysed their relationship to the maximum dispersal. We also documented the relative use by each individual for each habitat characteristic and analysed their relationships with survival and fatal encounters with a predator in the first year after release. In general, the presence of refugia or other areas that enabled animals to avoid detection, such as burrows and substrate, decreased the overall mortality as well as predator-mediated mortality. The presence of washes and substrate that enhanced the tortoises' ability to avoid detection also associated with the reduced dispersal away from the release site. These results indicate an important role for all three measured habitat characteristics in driving dispersal, survival or fatal encounters with a predator in the first year after translocation. Synthesis and applications. Resource managers using translocations as a conservation tool should prioritize acquiring data linking habitat to fitness. In particular, for species that depend on avoiding detection, refuges such as burrows and habitat that improved concealment had notable ability to improve the survival and dispersal. Our study on juvenile Mojave desert tortoises showed that refuge availability or the distributions of habitat appropriate for concealment are important considerations for identifying translocation sites for species highly dependent on crypsis, camouflage or other forms of habitat matching.},

We monitored variation in life history traits that are known or suspected to influence fitness in a population of damselflies parasitized by larval water mites. Mite prevalence and intensity varied considerably over 5 y and was often higher in females. Prevalence and intensity were highest in the years when the damselfly emergence periods were early and of short duration, which also corresponded to damselflies emerging at larger sizes. Mites appeared to exert negative effects on apparent survival in some years only, and only for females, suggesting that parasite-mediated selection on damselflies is variable and dependent on other factors such as emergence times, weather, and sex and body size of hosts.Nomenclature: Selys, 1862; Marshall, 1910.},

  abstract = {Species engage in mutually beneficial interspecific interactions (mutualisms) that shape their population dynamics in ecological communities. Species engaged in mutualisms vary greatly in their degree of dependence on their partner from complete dependence (e.g., yucca and yucca moth mutualism) to low dependence (e.g., generalist bee with multiple plant species). While current empirical studies show that, in mutualisms, partner dependence can alter the speed of a species' range expansion, there is no theory that provides conditions when expansion is sped up or slowed down. To address this, we built a spatially explicit model incorporating the population dynamics of two dispersing species interacting mutualistically. We explored how mutualisms impacted range expansion across a gradient of dependence (from complete independence to obligacy) between the two species. We then studied the conditions in which the magnitude of the mutualistic benefits could hinder versus enhance the speed of range expansion. We showed that either complete dependence, no dependence, or intermediate degree of dependence on a mutualist partner can lead to the greatest speeds of a focal species' range expansion based on the magnitude of benefits exchanged between partner species in the mutualism. We then showed how different degrees of dependence between species could alter the spatial distribution of the range expanding populations. Finally, we identified the conditions under which mutualistic interactions can turn exploitative across space, leading to the formation of a species' range limits. Our work highlights how couching mutualisms and mutualist dependence in a spatial context can provide insights about species range expansions, limits, and ultimately their distributions.},

We assembled a large, global dataset on mutualistic traits and species ranges to investigate how multiple plant-animal and plant-microbe mutualisms affect the spread of legumes and ants to novel ranges. We found that generalized mutualisms increase the likelihood that a species establishes and thrives beyond its native range, whereas specialized mutualisms either do not affect or reduce non-native spread. This pattern held in both legumes and ants, indicating that specificity between mutualistic partners is a key determinant of ecological success in a new habitat. Our global analysis shows that mutualism plays an important, if often overlooked, role in plant and insect invasions.},

  abstract = {Endolithic cyanobacteria are ubiquitous colonisers of organic and inorganic carbonate substrata that frequently attack the shells of mussels, eroding the shell to extract carbon, often with population infestation rates of {$>$}80\%. This reduces host physiological condition and ultimately leads to shell collapse and mortality, compromising the services provided by these important ecosystem engineers. While the ecological implications of this and similar interactions have been examined, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving the physiological responses of infested hosts remains limited. Using field and laboratory experiments, we assessed the energetic costs of cyanobacterial infestation to the intertidal brown mussel (Perna perna). In the field we found that growth (measured as both increase in shell length and rate of biomineralization) and reproductive potential of clean mussels are greater than those of infested individuals. To explore the mechanisms behind these effects, we compared the energy allocation of parasite-free and infested mussels using the scope for growth (SFG) framework. This revealed a lower SFG in parasitized mussels attributed to an energetic imbalance caused by increased standard metabolic rates, without compensation through increased feeding or reduced excretion of ammonia. Separate laboratory assays showed no differences in calcium uptake rates, indicating that infested mussels do not compensate for shell erosion through increased mineralization. This suggests that the increased maintenance costs detected reflect repair of the organic component of the inner nacreous layer of the shell, an energetically more demanding process than mineralization. Thus, parasite-inflicted damage reduces SFG directly through the need for increased basal metabolic rate to drive shell repair without compensatory increases in energy intake. This study provides a first perspective of the physiological mechanisms underlying this parasite-host interaction, a critical step towards a comprehensive understanding of the ecological processes driving dynamics of this intertidal ecosystem engineer.},

  abstract = {The distribution and wing morph proportions of Pterostichus melanarius (Ill.) and the possible effects of this exotic species on native carabid assemblages in central Alberta, Canada, were studied along pitfall trapping transects north and west out of the city of Edmonton. The species was first reported from Edmonton in 1959, but is today one of the most abundant carabids in the city and is also common up to ca. 70 km from Edmonton. The proportion of macropterous individuals of this dimorphic species increased from ca. 20\% in Edmonton to 60-70\% in the most distant populations, suggesting that flight is a major mode of range expansion in central Alberta. Contrary to previous studies in anthropogenic habitats, P. melanarius did not show negative pairwise associations with any of the abundant native species and was not associated with reduced numbers of species or individuals or with diminished carabid diversity in aspen-poplar forest. The success of the species in rapidly invading natural forested habitats, often viewed as less prone to invasion than are human-modified habitats, is attributed to good migratory ability of macropterous individuals, flexible habitat use and lack of biological resistance in the native assemblages.},

Adult winged forms of Aphis fabae Scop., the spring migrants (fundatrigeniae; alate virginoparae), the summer migrants (alate virginoparae) and the autumn migrants (gynoparae), were flown in an automated vertical wind tunnel, with a small green target presented every 60 s. On average, targeted flight developed in the spring and summer migrants after 19 and 15 min, respectively. However, in autumn migrants targeted flight occurred after 184 min of flight. No evidence of target approach was found up to 30 min prior to this time, although some movement towards the target was observed in the 30 min before the first response of autumn migrants, suggesting that a gradual change from migratory to targeted flight occurred. No correlation was found between aphid weight and the time to first response for spring or summer migrants, but a positive correlation was found for autumn migrants. Flight patterns of autumn migrants, in the absence of a target, are described and compared with flight patterns previously reported for summer migrants.},

More than one hundred exotic tree species were introduced to this island ca. 80 years ago, but invasive trees are found in high densities only in areas adjacent to plantations. With a series of greenhouse and field experiments we found lower mycorrhizal colonization levels and few fungal species far from original plantings, and key fungal mutualists are confined to areas near plantations, probably owing to dispersal limitations. Low inoculum levels far from the plantations are retarding the invasion. Our experiments indicate that positive interactions belowground can play a key but underappreciated role in invasion dynamics.},

Using a simple mechanistic model, we demonstrate that differences in the relative performances of predator and prey can cause strong threshold effects in the temperature dependence of attack rates. Empirical data on the attack rate of northern pike (Esox lucius) feeding on brown trout (Salmo trutta) confirm this result. Attack rates fell sharply below a threshold temperature of +11{$^\circ$}C, which corresponded to a shift in relative performance of pike and brown trout with respect to maximum attack and escape swimming speeds. The average attack speed of pike was an order of magnitude lower than the escape speed of brown trout at 5{$^\circ$}C, but approximately equal at temperatures above 11{$^\circ$}C. Thresholds in the temperature dependence of ecological rates can create tipping points in the responses of ecosystems to increasing temperatures. Thus, identifying thresholds is crucial when predicting future effects of climate warming.},

There was a continuous influx and exodus of toads during the breeding season.Only 15\% of 5937 captured toads were female. This disproportion might have resulted from later sexual maturation of females.Experiments showed that toads in breeding condition, within at least 80{\enspace}yd of their breeding site, did not move at random but oriented towards the site. After translocation, individuals demonstrated homing behavior, returning over 100{\enspace}yd to a particular breeding site, even when other active sites were available. Moreover, toads showed annual fidelity to a pool. Homing behavior evidently depended on familiarity with the characteristics of the breeding sites or the routes of influx to them.Experiments were performed on the significance to orientation of auditory, olfactory, hygrotactic, geotactic, and visual cues. Toad populations were capable of orienting towards a pool in the absence of a chorus, but were also able to orient towards the recording of a chorus broadcast from a position on land. Experiments involving surgery indicated that olfaction was not essential to orientation. Similarly, neither humidity nor topographic gradients appeared to be indispensable. Evidence on vision was inconclusive. Toads are probably able to utilize several characteristics of the breeding site, or its surroundings, during orientation. The relative significance of these characteristics probably depends on the nature of the environment.},

Ants are known to limit alate aphid dispersal by physically removing wings and also through chemical manipulation of the alate developmental pathway. This results in reduced dispersal and higher local densities of aphids, which benefit ants in terms of increased honeydew and prey availability. Here, we show that the walking movement of mutualistic apterous aphids is also reduced by ant semiochemicals. Aphids walk slower and their dispersal from an unsuitable patch is hampered by ants. If aphid walking dispersal has evolved as a means of natural enemy escape, then ant chemicals may act as a signal indicating protection; hence, reduced dispersal could be adaptive for aphids. If, however, dispersal is primarily a means to reduce competition or to maintain persistent metapopulations, then manipulation by ants could be detrimental. Such manipulation strategies, common in host-parasite and predator-prey interactions, may be more common in mutualism than expected.},

Indeed, we can make no theoretical predictions, however heuristic, about the distribution of phenotypic effects among factors fixed during adaptation nor about the expected ``size'' of the largest factor fixed. Study of this problem requires taking into account that populations gradually approach a phenotypic optimum during adaptation via the stepwise substitution of favorable mutations. Using Fisher's geometric model of adaptation, I analyze this approach to the optimum, and derive an approximate solution to the size distribution of factors fixed during adaptation. I further generalize these results to allow the input of any distribution of mutational effects. The distribution of factors fixed during adaptation assumes a pleasingly simple, exponential form. This result is remarkably insensitive to changes in the fitness function and in the distribution of mutational effects. An exponential trend among factors fixed appears to be a general property of adaptation toward a fixed optimum.},

For interspecific cooperation (mutualism), most approaches to this paradox focus on costs and benefits of individual partners and the strategies mutualists use to associate with beneficial partners. However, natural selection acts on lifetime fitness, and most mutualists, particularly longer-lived species interacting with shorter-lived partners (e.g., corals and zooxanthellae, tropical trees and mycorrhizae) interact with multiple partner species throughout ontogeny. Determining how multiple partnerships might interactively affect lifetime fitness is a crucial unexplored link in understanding the evolution and maintenance of cooperation. The tropical tree Acacia drepanolobium associates with four symbiotic ant species whose short-term individual effects range from mutualistic to parasitic. Using a long-term dataset, we show that tree fitness is enhanced by partnering sequentially with sets of different ant symbionts over the ontogeny of a tree. These sets include a ``sterilization parasite'' that prevents reproduction and another that reduces tree survivorship. Trees associating with partner sets that include these ``parasites'' enhance lifetime fitness by trading off survivorship and fecundity at different life stages. Our results demonstrate the importance of evaluating mutualism within a community context and suggest that lifespan inequalities among mutualists may help cooperation persist in the face of exploitation.},

We recorded the distance during the breeding season to human habitation for 50 pairs of closely related bird species, where one was closely associated with humans while the other species was not. The degree of urbanization was larger as was range size and abundance in the species more closely associated to humans. Flight initiation distance was shorter, and species closely associated with humans were more abundant in ancestral rural habitats. Likewise, species more closely associated with humans reproduced earlier and during longer periods. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that urbanization is promoted by interspecific competition. Resulting isolation by urban habitat may further facilitate contemporary adaptation to urban environments.},

Using a comprehensive literature review (885 range limits), we find that biotic interactions, including competition, predation and parasitism, contributed to {$>$}60\% of range limits and influenced species' warm limits more often than cool limits. Abiotic factors contributed more often than biotic interactions to cool range limits, but temperature contributed frequently to both cool and warm limits.

  abstract = {Dispersal is key for maintaining biodiversity at local- and regional scales in metacommunities. However, little is known about the combined effects of dispersal and climate change on biodiversity. Theory predicts that alpha-diversity is maximized at intermediate dispersal rates, resulting in a hump-shaped diversity-dispersal relationship. This relationship is predicted to flatten when competition increases. We anticipate that this same flattening will occur with increased temperature because, in the rising part of the temperature performance curve, interspecific competition is predicted to increase. We explored this question using aquatic communities of Sarracenia purpurea from early- and late-successional stages, in which we simulated four levels of dispersal and four temperature scenarios. With increased dispersal, the hump shape was observed consistently in late successional communities, but only in higher temperature treatments in early succession. Increased temperature did not flatten the hump-shape relationship, but decreased the level of alpha- and gamma-diversity. Interestingly, higher temperatures negatively impacted small-bodied species. These metacommunity-level extinctions likely relaxed interspecific competition, which could explain the absence of flattening of the diversity-dispersal relationship. Our findings suggest that climate change will cause extinctions both at local- and global- scales and emphasize the importance of intermediate levels of dispersal as an insurance for local diversity.},

Mutualism can limit range expansion when plants cannot find a compatible partner in a novel habitat, or facilitate range expansion when mutualism increases a plant's niche breadth. Polyploids are also expected to have greater niche breadth because of greater self-compatibility and phenotypic plasticity, increasing invasion success. For 847 legume species, we compiled data from published sources to estimate ploidy, symbiotic status with rhizobia, specificity on rhizobia, and the number of introduced ranges. We found that diploid species have had limited spread around the globe regardless of whether they are symbiotic or how many rhizobia partners they can host. Polyploids, by contrast, have been successfully introduced to many new ranges, but interactions with rhizobia constrain their range expansion. In a hidden state model of trait evolution, we also found evidence of a high rate of re-diploidization in symbiotic legume lineages, suggesting that symbiosis and ploidy may interact at macroevolutionary scales. Overall, our results suggest that symbiosis with rhizobia limits range expansion when legumes are polyploid but not diploid.},

In the second part of the book, these concepts are illustrated with data science examples using the R language. In the third part, statistical modelling approaches are demonstrated using real world data examples. After reading this book, the reader will be well equipped to avoid a number of major spatial data analysis errors. The book gives a detailed explanation of the core spatial software packages for R: sf for simple feature access, and stars for raster and vector data cubes -- array data with spatial and temporal dimensions. It also shows how geometrical operations change when going from a flat space to the surface of a sphere, which is what sf and stars use when coordinates are not projected (degrees longitude/latitude). Separate chapters detail a variety of plotting approaches for spatial maps using R, and different ways of handling very large vector or raster (imagery) datasets, locally, in databases, or in the cloud.

  abstract = {The importance of dispersal rates and distances has long been appreciated by ecologists and evolutionary biologists. An emerging field of research is revealing how temporal variation in dispersal can substantially influence ecological and evolutionary outcomes. We review how dispersal rates can temporally vary substantially in many ecosystems, a pattern that is particularly well-documented for aquatic organisms but is likely pervasive in terrestrial ecosystems as well. We then synthesize the effects of temporal variation in dispersal on five key ecological and evolutionary processes: 1) metapopulation dynamics, 2) local adaptation, 3) range limits and range expansions, 4) species coexistence and 5) metacommunity dynamics. Our review demonstrates that temporal variation in dispersal is more than just statistical `noise' but can in fact lead to different outcomes than expected were dispersal temporally constant. For example, increasing the magnitude of temporal variation in dispersal can lead to lower metapopulation growth rates, permit greater local adaptation, facilitate and accelerate range expansion, increase regional coexistence, and alter local and regional species diversity. These effects of temporal variation in dispersal can inform conservation and natural resource management decisions such as prioritization in spatial planning, management of spillover from domesticated or captive populations into native populations, and the design of effective control strategies for invasive species.},

  abstract = {Climate change can have strong effects on species interactions and community structure. Temperature-dependent effects on predator--prey interactions are a major mechanism through which these effects occur. To understand the net effects of predator attack rates and dynamic windows of prey vulnerability, we examined the impacts of temperature on the interaction of a caterpillar (Arctia virginalis) and its ant predator (Formica lasioides). We conducted field experiments to examine attack rates on caterpillars relative to temperature, ant abundance, and body size, and laboratory experiments to determine the effects of temperature on caterpillar growth. We modeled temperature-dependent survival based on the integrated effects of temperature-dependent growth and temperature- and size-dependent predation. Attack rates on caterpillars increased with warming and ant recruitment, but decreased with caterpillar size. Caterpillar growth rates increased with temperature, narrowing the window of vulnerability. The model predicted that net caterpillar survival would decrease with temperature, suggesting that A. virginalis populations could be depressed with future climate warming. Theoretical work suggests that the net outcome of predator--prey interactions with increasing temperature depends on the respective responses of interacting species in terms of velocity across space, whereas the present study suggests the importance of effects of temperature on prey window of vulnerability, or ``velocity'' across time.},

While advances in deep learning and computer vision have enabled markerless pose estimation in individual animals, extending these to multiple animals presents unique challenges for studies of social behaviors or animals in their natural environments. Here we present Social LEAP Estimates Animal Poses (SLEAP), a machine learning system for multi-animal pose tracking. This system enables versatile workflows for data labeling, model training and inference on previously unseen data. SLEAP features an accessible graphical user interface, a standardized data model, a reproducible configuration system, over 30 model architectures, two approaches to part grouping and two approaches to identity tracking. We applied SLEAP to seven datasets across flies, bees, mice and gerbils to systematically evaluate each approach and architecture, and we compare it with other existing approaches. SLEAP achieves greater accuracy and speeds of more than 800 frames per second, with latencies of less than 3.5\,ms at full 1,024\,{\texttimes}\,1,024 image resolution. This makes SLEAP usable for real-time applications, which we demonstrate by controlling the behavior of one animal on the basis of the tracking and detection of social interactions with another animal.},

  abstract = {Many insects possess beneficial bacterial symbionts that occupy specialized host cells and are maternally transmitted. As a consequence of their host-restricted lifestyle, these symbionts often possess reduced genomes and cannot be cultured outside hosts, limiting their study. The bacterial species Serratia symbiotica was originally characterized as noncultured strains that live as mutualistic symbionts of aphids and are vertically transmitted through transovarial endocytosis within the mother's body. More recently, culturable strains of S. symbiotica were discovered that retain a larger set of ancestral Serratia genes, are gut pathogens in aphid hosts, and are principally transmitted via a fecal-oral route. We find that these culturable strains, when injected into pea aphids, replicate in the hemolymph and are pathogenic. Unexpectedly, they are also capable of maternal transmission via transovarial endocytosis: using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged strains, we observe that pathogenic S. symbiotica strains, but not Escherichia coli, are endocytosed into early embryos. Furthermore, pathogenic S. symbiotica strains are compartmentalized into specialized aphid cells in a fashion similar to that of mutualistic S. symbiotica strains during later stages of embryonic development. However, infected embryos do not appear to develop properly, and offspring infected by a transovarial route are not observed. Thus, cultured pathogenic strains of S. symbiotica have the latent capacity to transition to lifestyles as mutualistic symbionts of aphid hosts, but persistent vertical transmission is blocked by their pathogenicity. To transition into stably inherited symbionts, culturable S. symbiotica strains may need to adapt to regulate their titer, limit their pathogenicity, and/or provide benefits to aphids that outweigh their cost. IMPORTANCE Insects have evolved various mechanisms to reliably transmit their beneficial bacterial symbionts to the next generation. Sap-sucking insects, including aphids, transmit symbionts by endocytosis of the symbiont into cells of the early embryo within the mother's body. Experimental studies of this process are hampered by the inability to culture or genetically manipulate host-restricted, symbiotic bacteria. Serratia symbiotica is a bacterial species that includes strains ranging from obligate, heritable symbionts to gut pathogens. We demonstrate that culturable S. symbiotica strains, which are aphid gut pathogens, can be maternally transmitted. Cultured S. symbiotica therefore possesses a latent capacity for evolving a host-restricted lifestyle and can be used to understand the transition from pathogenicity to beneficial symbiosis.},

We use a combination of a 10-year field study of a perch (Perca fluviatilis) population and quantitative within-season modeling of individual and population-level dynamics to investigate which mechanisms are most likely to drive the dynamics of the studied perch population. We focused on three main aspects to explain observed discrepancies between earlier model predictions and data: (1) introduction of more than one shared resource between cannibals and victims, (2) whether or not several victim age cohorts are necessary to allow giant growth, and (3) the intensity of inter-cohort competition between young-of-the-year (YOY) perch and 1-yr-old perch. At the start of the study period, the perch population was dominated by ``stunted'' perch individuals, and recruitment of perch to an age of 1-yr-old was negligible. Following a major death in adult perch, strong recruitments of perch to 1-yr-old were thereafter observed for a number of years. As 1-yr-olds these successful recruiters subsequently starved to death due to competition with the new YOY. The few surviving adult perch accelerated substantially in growth and became ``giants.'' At the end of the study period, the perch population moved back to the situation with stunted individuals. There was a high agreement between observed diets of cannibalistic perch and those predicted by the model for both the stunted and the giant phases. Analyses of growth rates showed that cannibalistic perch could become giants on a diet of YOY perch only, but that a supplement with the second shared resource (macroinvertebrates) was needed to reach the observed sizes. Modeling of growth and diet in the giant phase showed an exploitative competitive effect of YOY perch on 1-yr-old perch, but a restriction in habitat use of 1-yr-old perch had to be assumed to yield the observed growth rate and diet. The resource dynamics of zooplankton and macroinvertebrates were both accurately predicted by the model. Also, YOY perch mortality was accurately predicted and, furthermore, suggested that one of the trawling methods used may underestimate the number of YOY perch when they increase in size. We conclude that the presence of a second shared resource and the restricted habitat use and absence of cannibalistic consumption by 1-yr-old perch individuals are two important mechanisms to explain the discrepancy between model predictions and data. Our results also point to the fact that that the dynamics observed may be explained by complex dynamics not involving the presence of a giant and dwarf cycle.},

Here, we develop a model of how temperature affects food web connectance, a powerful driver of population dynamics and community structure. We use the Arrhenius equation to add temperature dependence of foraging traits to an existing model of food web structure. The model predicts potentially large temperature effects on connectance. Temperature-sensitive food webs exhibit slopes of up to 0.01 units of connectance per 1{$^\circ$}C change in temperature. This corresponds to changes in diet breadth of one resource item per 2{$^\circ$}C (assuming a food web containing 50 species). Less sensitive food webs exhibit slopes down to 0.0005, which corresponds to about one resource item per 40{$^\circ$}C. Relative sizes of the activation energies of attack rate and handling time determine whether warming increases or decreases connectance. Differences in temperature sensitivity are explained by differences between empirical food webs in the body size distributions of organisms. We conclude that models of temperature effects on community structure and dynamics urgently require considerable development, and also more and better empirical data to parameterize and test them.},

Parasites and pathogens can have strong regulatory effects on their host population and, in doing so, exert selection pressure on host life history. We construct a simple individual-based model of host--parasite dynamics during range expansion. This model shows that the parasites and pathogens of a range-expanding host are likely to be absent from the host's invasion front, because stochastic events (serial founder events) in low-density frontal populations result in local extinctions or transmission failure of the parasite/pathogen and, hence, a preponderance of uninfected hosts in the invasion vanguard. This pattern is true for both density-dependent and density-independent transmission rates, although it is exacerbated in the case of density-dependent transmission because, in this case, transmission rates also decline on the front. Data from field surveys on the prevalence of lungworms (Rhabdias pseudosphaerocephala) in invasive cane toads (Bufo marinus) support these predictions, in showing that toads in newly invaded areas of tropical Australia lack the parasite, which only arrives 1--3 years after the toads themselves. The resultant ``honeymoon phase'' immediately post-invasion, when individuals in the invasion-front population are virtually pathogen-free, may lead to altered host population dynamics on the invasion front, causing, for example, high densities in invasion-front populations, followed by a decline in numbers as parasites and pathogens arrive and begin to reduce host viability. The honeymoon phase may ultimately impact the evolution of life-history investment strategies in both host and parasite on the invasion vanguard, as hosts are released from immune challenges and parasites continuously expand into a favorable and unoccupied niche.},

  abstract = {Climate change likely will lead to increasingly favourable environmental conditions for many parasites. However, predictions regarding parasitism's impacts often fail to account for the likely variability in host distribution and how this may alter parasite occurrence. Here, we investigate potential distributional shifts in the meningeal worm, Parelaphostrongylosis tenuis, a protostrongylid nematode commonly found in white-tailed deer in North America, whose life cycle also involves a free-living stage and a gastropod intermediate host. We modelled the distribution of the hosts and free-living larva as a complete assemblage to assess whether a complex trophic system will lead to an overall increase in parasite distribution with climate change, or whether divergent environmental niches may promote an ecological mismatch. Using an ensemble approach to climate modelling under two different carbon emission scenarios, we show that whereas the overall trend is for an increase in niche breadth for each species, mismatches arise in habitat suitability of the free-living larva vs. the definitive and intermediate hosts. By incorporating these projected mismatches into a combined model, we project a shift in parasite distribution accounting for all steps in the transmission cycle, and identify that overall habitat suitability of the parasite will decline in the Great Plains and southeastern USA, but will increase in the Boreal Forest ecoregion, particularly in Alberta. These results have important implications for wildlife conservation and management due to the known pathogenicity of parelaphostrongylosis to alternate hosts including moose, caribou and elk. Our results suggest that disease risk forecasts which fail to consider biotic interactions may be overly simplistic, and that accounting for each of the parasite's life stages is key to refining predicted responses to climate change.},

Cootes Drive is a 2.5-km 4-lane highway that bisects wetland habitat used for nesting and overwintering by snapping turtles. We hypothesized that turtle mortality from collisions with vehicles on Cootes Drive has caused a male bias and a decline in the population as turtles attempt to access habitat on both sides of the road. Capture--mark--recapture studies confirmed a dramatic decline in the turtle population from 941 individuals in 1985 to 177 individuals in 2002, a loss of 764 individuals in only 17 yrs. Using the same data, we also determined that the population has been significantly male-biased since 1985. Using 2009--2016 road mortality data obtained from the Dundas Turtle Watch (a citizen-science program), we completed a population viability analysis using the 2002 population size estimate to isolate the impact of road mortality. We found that this population is at risk of extirpation due to road mortality. The population range overlapped with the Cootes Drive and 7 of the 10 tracked turtles had individual home ranges that overlapped with the road. Our findings support the hypothesis that road mortality has contributed to the dramatic decline in the snapping turtle population in Cootes Paradise Marsh. This population is in jeopardy of extirpation; therefore, exclusion fencing must be installed for an extended distance along both sides of surrounding roads to prevent turtles from crossing the road and to promote their use of existing aquatic culverts.},

When environmental temperatures are below these optima, increasing temperature will increase their rates of energy consumption, resulting in a corresponding increase in the risk of starvation. For that reason we predicted that within this temperature range, food is of greater value at higher temperatures so fish should be willing to incur greater costs to obtain it. To test this hypothesis, we measured how the activity and foraging rates of the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) changed with temperature at 4, 15, and 24 {$^\circ$}C. As expected, fish activity and foraging were greater at higher temperatures. We then measured the impact of predation risk on foraging decisions at 5, 15, and 23 {$^\circ$}C. At 5 and 15 {$^\circ$}C, the risk of predation had a significant effect on foraging decisions, but there was no effect at 23 {$^\circ$}C. These results demonstrate that increasing temperatures below their optimal level diminish the impact of predation risk on foraging behaviour and may mean that the direct consumptive effect of predators on aquatic communities will be greater at warmer temperatures while the risk of predation will become a less important factor, and vice versa.},

Our results also show that parasites acquired via cannibalism are viable, develop into fertile adults, and reduce the locomotor performance of the hosts.

Major barriers to citizen science were mostly social and institutional, although projects should also consider access to suitable technology and language barriers. Policy implications. Citizen science can provide data to support decision-making and reporting against international targets. Participation can also provide societal benefits, informing and empowering people, thus supporting the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. In developing countries, innovation is needed to further develop culturally relevant citizen science that benefits participants and end users.

We take the case of delayed predator-induced dispersal (PID) in aphids to explore in which way current environmental conditions may be utilized as an appropriate signal for dispersal decisions. In aphids, the presence of predators triggers the production of winged offspring that may later leave the plant and shift their center of activity permanently. Using individual-based simulations as well as analytical approximations, we explore under which conditions PID is likely to evolve. We demonstrate that this requires substantial temporal correlation in predation risk and weak competition among prey; these conditions may be fulfilled in the aphid system. We discuss the analogy between the specific case of PID and the evolution of conditional emigration in the face of spatiotemporally correlated deterioration in reproduction or survival.},

Despite this cost, sociality is widespread in a large range of taxonomic groups. In this context, hosts would be expected to have evolved behavioral mechanisms to reduce the risk of parasite infection. Few empirical studies have focused on the influence of pathogen-mediated selection on the evolution of antiparasitic behavior in wild vertebrates. We report an adaptive functional relationship between parasitism and social behavior in mandrills, associated with evidence that they are able to gauge parasite status of their group members. Using long-term observations, controlled experiments, and chemical analyses, we show that (i) wild mandrills avoid grooming conspecifics infected with orofecally transmitted parasites; (ii) mandrills receive significantly more grooming after treatment that targets these parasites; (iii) parasitism influences the host's fecal odors; and (iv) mandrills selectively avoid fecal material from parasitized conspecifics. These behavioral adaptations reveal that selecting safe social partners may help primates to cope with parasite-mediated costs of sociality and that ``behavioral immunity'' plays a crucial role in the coevolutionary dynamics between hosts and their parasites.},

Fundamental questions regarding how mutualistic associations arise and evolve in nature remain, however, poorly studied. The aphid-Serratia symbiotica bacterium interaction represents a valuable model to study mechanisms shaping these symbiotic interspecific interactions. S. symbiotica strains capable of living independently of aphid hosts have recently been isolated. These strains probably resulted from horizontal transfers and could be an evolutionary link to an intra-organismal symbiosis. In this context, we used the tripartite interaction between the aphid Aphis fabae, a cultivable S. symbiotica bacterium, and the host plant Vicia faba to evaluate the bacterium ability to circulate in this system, exploring its environmental acquisition by aphids and horizontal transmission between aphids via the host plant. Using molecular analyses and fluorescence techniques, we showed that the cultivable S. symbiotica can enter the plants and induce new bacterial infections in aphids feeding on these new infected plants. Remarkably, we also found that the bacterium can have positive effects on the host plant, mainly at the root level. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that cultivable S. symbiotica can be horizontally transferred from infected to uninfected aphids sharing the same plant, providing first direct evidence that plants can mediate horizontal transmission of certain strains of this symbiont species. These findings highlight the importance of considering symbiotic associations in complex systems where microorganisms can circulate between different compartments. Our study can thus have major implications for understanding the multifaceted interactions between microbes, insects and plants.},

  abstract = {Symbioses are significant drivers of insect evolutionary ecology. Despite recent findings that these associations can emerge from environmentally derived bacterial precursors, there is still little information on how these potential progenitors of insect symbionts circulate in trophic systems. Serratia symbiotica represents a valuable model for deciphering evolutionary scenarios of bacterial acquisition by insects, as its diversity includes gut-associated strains that retained the ability to live independently of their hosts, representing a potential reservoir for symbioses emergence. Here, we conducted a field study to examine the distribution and diversity of S. symbiotica found in aphid populations, and in different compartments of their surrounding environment. Twenty \% of aphid colonies were infected with S. symbiotica, including a wide diversity of strains with varied tissue tropism corresponding to different lifestyle. We also showed that the prevalence of S. symbiotica is influenced by seasonal temperatures. We found that S. symbiotica was present in non-aphid species and in host plants, and that its prevalence in these samples was higher when associated aphid colonies were infected. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses suggest the existence of horizontal transfers between the different trophic levels. These results provide a new picture of the pervasiveness of an insect symbiont in nature.},

  abstract = {For many species, not all required resources are contained in breeding habitat. Such species depend on landscape complementation, i.e., linking together different landscape elements through movement, to complete their life cycles. We suggest that the dichotomous habitat classification of many metapopulation analyses (habitat vs. nonhabitat) masks our ability to detect metapopulation effects for such species. We tested this using a species for which landscape complementation is obligate and metapopulation structure is likely: Rana pipiens, the northern leopard frog. We used breeding chorus survey data to index relative abundance of leopard frogs in 34 ``core'' ponds and conducted Poisson regression analysis to determine the effects on frog density of local pond habitat, availability of summer habitat (landscape complementation), and number of occupied ponds in the surrounding landscapes (metapopulation structure). All of these factors had statistically significant effects on frog density. However, when summer habitat was not included in the statistical model, the metapopulation structure was no longer significant; i.e., its effect was masked. Our results suggest that one must be cautious in applying the results of metapopulation analyses to species for which the habitat vs. nonhabitat categorization of the landscape is not appropriate. The potential for rescue and recolonization to maintain a regional population must be assessed within the constraints of the entire landscape.},

  abstract = {Understanding how abiotic conditions influence dispersal patterns of organisms is important for understanding the degree to which species can track and persist in the face of changing climate. The goal of this study was to understand how weather conditions influence the dispersal pattern of multiple nonmigratory grasshopper species from lower elevation grassland habitats in which they complete their life-cycles to higher elevations that extend beyond their range limits. Using over a decade of weekly spring to late-summer field survey data along an elevational gradient, we explored how abundance and richness of dispersing grasshoppers were influenced by temperature, precipitation, and wind speed and direction. We also examined how changes in population sizes at lower elevations might influence these patterns. We observed that the abundance of dispersing grasshoppers along the gradient declined 4-fold from the foothills to the subalpine and increased with warmer conditions and when wind flow patterns were mild or in the downslope direction. Thirty-eight unique grasshopper species from lowland sites were detected as dispersers across the survey years, and warmer years and weak upslope wind conditions also increased the richness of these grasshoppers. The pattern of grasshoppers along the gradient was not sex biased. The positive effect of temperature on dispersal rates was likely explained by an increase in dispersal propensity rather than by an increase in the density of grasshoppers at low elevation sites. The results of this study support the hypothesis that the dispersal patterns of organisms are influenced by changing climatic conditions themselves and as such, that this context-dependent dispersal response should be considered when modeling and forecasting the ability of species to respond to climate change.},

Experiments conducted on individual invertebrate hosts, however, suggest that starved hosts may be a poor resource for parasites and that heavily infected old hosts may be more susceptible to stress, causing parasite populations to decline when their host population faces food shortages. In this epidemiological experiment, we exposed infected and uninfected Daphnia magna populations, which had been kept for many generations under a constant high food supply, to reduced food resources. Using the microsporidian gut parasite Glugoides intestinalis, which is exclusively horizontally transmitted, we tracked changes in parasite and host population size as well as host body length to elucidate how food shortages for the hosts influence host and parasite population dynamics. In both infected and uninfected populations, food shortage led to an approximately equal reduction in host density and changes in host body length distribution. Large hosts suffered a higher mortality than smaller hosts, which significantly reduced the mean body length in the host populations; however, this change was stronger in the infected populations and went hand-in-hand with a reduction in parasite spore load (a measure of intensity of infection) and prevalence. This effect disappeared after six weeks of food shortage, when the populations reached a new equilibrium. Our results indicate that in this system food stress impairs parasite spread and that host mortality is an important factor in regulating parasite abundance at the population level.},

When this occurs, reproductive surpluses from productive source habitats may maintain populations in sink habitats, where local reproductive success fails to keep pace with local mortality. For animals with active habitat selection, an equilibrium with both source and sink habitats occupied can be both ecologically and evolutionarily stable. If the surplus population of the source is large and the per capita deficit in the sink is small, only a small fraction of the total population will occur in areas where local reproduction is sufficient to compensate for local mortality. In this sense, the realized niche may be larger than the fundamental niche. Consequently, the particular species assemblage occupying any local study site may consist of a mixture of source and sink populations and may be as much or more influenced by the type and proximity of other habitats as by the resources and other conditions at the site.},

In terrestrial ecosystems, range shifts alter aboveground-belowground interactions, influencing species abundance, community composition, ecosystem processes and services, and feedbacks within communities and ecosystems. Thus, range shifts may result in no-analog communities where foundation species and community genetics play unprecedented roles, possibly leading to novel ecosystems. Long-distance dispersal can enhance the disruption of aboveground-belowground interactions of plants, herbivores, pathogens, symbiotic mutualists, and decomposer organisms. These effects are most likely stronger for latitudinal than for altitudinal range shifts. Disrupted aboveground-belowground interactions may have influenced historical postglacial range shifts as well. Assisted migration without considering aboveground-belowground interactions could enhance risks of such range shift--induced invasions.},

  abstract = {Climate change is altering the timing of life history events in a wide array of species, many of which are involved in mutualistic interactions. Because many mutualisms can form only if partner species are able to locate each other in time, differential phenological shifts are likely to influence their strength, duration and outcome. At the extreme, climate change-driven shifts in phenology may result in phenological mismatch: the partial or complete loss of temporal overlap of mutualistic species. We have a growing understanding of how, when, and why phenological change can alter one type of mutualism--pollination. However, as we show here, there has been a surprising lack of attention to other types of mutualism. We generate a set of predictions about the characteristics that may predispose mutualisms in general to phenological mismatches. We focus not on the consequences of such mismatches but rather on the likelihood that mismatches will develop. We explore the influence of three key characteristics of mutualism: 1) intimacy, 2) seasonality and duration, and 3) obligacy and specificity. We predict that the following characteristics of mutualism may increase the likelihood of phenological mismatch: 1) a non-symbiotic life history in which co-dispersal is absent; 2) brief, seasonal interactions; and 3) facultative, generalized interactions. We then review the limited available data in light of our a priori predictions and point to mutualisms that are more and less likely to be at risk of becoming phenologically mismatched, emphasizing the need for research on mutualisms other than plant--pollinator interactions. Future studies should explicitly focus on mutualism characteristics to determine whether and how changing phenologies will affect mutualistic interactions.},

  abstract = {Warming could strongly stabilize or destabilize populations and food webs by changing the interaction strengths between predators and their prey. Predicting the consequences of warming requires understanding how temperature affects ingestion (energy gain) and metabolism (energy loss). Here, we studied the temperature dependence of metabolism and ingestion in laboratory experiments with terrestrial arthropods (beetles and spiders). From this data, we calculated ingestion efficiencies (ingestion/metabolism) and per capita interaction strengths in the short and long term. Additionally, we investigated if and how body mass changes these temperature dependencies. For both predator groups, warming increased metabolic rates substantially, whereas temperature effects on ingestion rates were weak. Accordingly, the ingestion efficiency (the ratio of ingestion to metabolism) decreased in all treatments. This result has two possible consequences: on the one hand, it suggests that warming of natural ecosystems could increase intrinsic population stability, meaning less fluctuations in population density; on the other hand, decreasing ingestion efficiencies may also lead to higher extinction risks because of starvation. Additionally, predicted long-term per capita interaction strengths decreased with warming, which suggests an increase in perturbation stability of populations, i.e., a higher probability of returning to the same equilibrium density after a small perturbation. Together, these results suggest that warming has complex and potentially profound effects on predator--prey interactions and food-web stability.},

Feeding rates, as all biological rates, depend on consumer and resource body masses and environmental temperature. Despite five decades of research on functional responses as quantitative models of feeding rates, a unifying framework of how they scale with body masses and temperature is still lacking. This is perplexing, considering that the strength of functional responses (i.e. interaction strengths) is crucially important for the stability of simple consumer--resource systems and the persistence, sustainability and biodiversity of complex communities. Here, we present the largest currently available database on functional response parameters and their scaling with body mass and temperature. Moreover, these data are integrated across ecosystems and metabolic types of species. Surprisingly, we found general temperature dependencies that differed from the Arrhenius terms predicted by metabolic models. Additionally, the body-mass-scaling relationships were more complex than expected and differed across ecosystems and metabolic types. At local scales (taxonomically narrow groups of consumer--resource pairs), we found hump-shaped deviations from the temperature and body-mass-scaling relationships. Despite the complexity of our results, these body-mass- and temperature-scaling models remain useful as a mechanistic basis for predicting the consequences of warming for interaction strengths, population dynamics and network stability across communities differing in their size structure.},

The intraspecific variation of symbionts remains poorly assessed while phenotypic effects and transmission behaviors, which are key processes for the persistence and evolution of symbioses, may differ widely depending on the symbiont strains. Serratia symbiotica is one of the most frequent symbiont species in aphids and a valuable model to assess this intraspecific variation since it includes both facultative and obligate symbiotic strains. Despite evidence that some facultative S. symbiotica strains exhibit a free-living capacity, the presence of these strains in wild aphid populations, as well as in insects with which they maintain regular contact, has never been demonstrated. Here, we examined the prevalence, diversity, and tissue tropism of S. symbiotica in wild aphids and associated ants. We found a high occurrence of S. symbiotica infection in ant populations, especially when having tended infected aphid colonies. We also found that the S. symbiotica diversity includes strains found located within the gut of aphids and ants. In the latter, this tissue tropism was found restricted to the proventriculus. Altogether, these findings highlight the extraordinary diversity and versatility of an insect symbiont and suggest the existence of novel routes for symbiont acquisition in insects.},

Many insect species may be indirectly affected through their nutritional dependence on mutualistic bacteria. Indeed, these bacterial partners generally have a highly reduced and static genome, resulting from millions of years of coevolution and isolation in insect cells, and have limited adaptive capacity. The dependence of insects on bacterial partners with narrow environmental tolerance also restricts their ability to adapt, potentially increasing the risk of their extinction, particularly in a world characterized by increasing and fluctuating temperatures. In this review, we examine how climate change can affect the evolutionary trajectories of bacterial mutualism in insects by considering the possible alternatives that may compensate for the dependence on bacterial partners that have become `Achilles' heels'. We also discuss the beneficial and compensatory effects, as well as the antagonistic effects associated with so-called facultative symbionts in the context of an increased incidence of transient extreme temperatures.},

The aphid symbiont Serratia symbiotica is a valuable candidate for studying the evolution of bacterial symbiosis in insects because it includes a wide diversity of strains that reflect the diverse relationships in which bacteria can be engaged with insects, from pathogenic interactions to obligate intracellular mutualism. The recent discovery of culturable strains, which are hypothesized to resemble the ancestors of intracellular strains, provide an opportunity to study the mechanisms underlying bacterial symbiosis in its early stages. In this study, we analyzed the genomes of three of these culturable strains that are pathogenic to aphid hosts, and performed comparative genomic analyses including mutualistic host-dependent strains. All three genomes are larger than those of the host-restricted S. symbiotica strains described so far, and show significant enrichment in pseudogenes and mobile elements, suggesting that these three pathogenic strains are in the early stages of the adaptation to their host. Compared to their intracellular mutualistic relatives, the three strains harbor a greater diversity of genes coding for virulence factors and metabolic pathways, suggesting that they are likely adapted to infect new hosts and are a potential source of metabolic innovation for insects. The presence in their genomes of secondary metabolism gene clusters associated with the production of antimicrobial compounds and phytotoxins supports the hypothesis that S. symbiotia symbionts evolved from plant-associated strains and that plants may serve as intermediate hosts. Mutualistic associations between insects and bacteria are the result of independent transitions to endosymbiosis initiated by the acquisition of environmental progenitors. In this context, the genomes of free-living S. symbiotica strains provide a rare opportunity to study the inventory of genes held by bacterial associates of insects that are at the gateway to a host-dependent lifestyle.},

Belonging to a genus where many members have been described as pathogen in invertebrates, Serratia symbiotica is one of the most common facultative partners found in aphids. The recent discovery of strains able to grow outside their host allowed us to simulate environmental acquisition of symbiotic bacteria by aphids. Here, we performed an experiment to characterize the A. pisum response to the ingestion of the free-living S. symbiotica CWBI-2.3T in comparison to the ingestion of the pathogenic Serratia marcescens Db11 at the early steps in the infection process. We found that, while S. marcescens Db11 killed the aphids within a few days, S. symbiotica CWBI-2.3T did not affect host survival and colonized the whole digestive tract within a few days. Gene expression analysis of immune genes suggests that S. symbiotica CWBI-2.3T did not trigger an immune reaction, while S. marcescens Db11 did, and supports the hypothesis of a fine-tuning of the host immune response set-up for fighting pathogens while maintaining mutualistic partners. Our results also suggest that the lysosomal system and the JNK pathway are possibly involved in the regulation of invasive bacteria in aphids and that the activation of the JNK pathway is IMD-independent in the pea aphid.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic habitat alteration may affect the dispersal service provided by avian seed dispersers, ultimately causing regeneration collapse, through a decay in both the quantitative (seed removal) and qualitative (seed arrival to safe sites) components of seed dispersal effectiveness. However, despite its implications for management in real-world landscapes, few studies have investigated the shifts in components of seed dispersal effectiveness resulting from habitat alteration. We advocate the use of stage-specific transition probabilities, combined with data on seed shadows and bird abundance and mobility, for a mechanistic inference of the consequences for recruitment of the disruption of plant-frugivore mutualism in altered habitats. Such an approach allows the identification of regeneration bottlenecks, evaluates the differential contribution to recruitment of quantitative and qualitative components of seed dispersal, and provides the means to compare seed dispersal limitation. We exemplify our conceptual approach with studies of seed dispersal and recruitment in the wild olive tree in unaltered and severely altered adjacent sites. We show that simplification of the habitat substantially affected bird abundance, diversity and mobility, which caused a reduction in fruit removal and a concomitant simplification of the seed shadows compared to the unaltered site. Linked to these shifts, postdispersal seed survival and seedling emergence and survival were affected. The final outcome of habitat alteration was the collapse of the regeneration dynamics with very few seeds escaping the influence of maternal plants and reaching the safest sites for recruitment (dispersal limitation). As predicted, the collapse in the regeneration dynamics resulted from severe decays in the quantitative but especially in the qualitative components of seed dispersal effectiveness. Management of fleshy-fruited plant populations in altered habitats should thus pay attention to landscape elements that promote frugivore abundance, diversity and mobility and that alleviate the dispersal limitation.},

We tested this hypothesis in a replicated pond experiment in which a bimodal size distribution of young-of-year spot Leiostomus xanthurus was exposed to two sizes of southern flounder Paralichthvs lethostigina, each predator size-group present alone or together, at densities providing equal predation pressure, After 3 weeks, we examined cohort survival and size distributions of remaining spot. In the no-predator controls, spot size-frequency distributions were essentially unchanged, and survival of the large- and small-spot cohorts was similar. However, the size distribution of survivors, and the relative survival of large- and small-spot cohorts, differed markedly with the size structure of the predator assemblage, In the presence of small southern flounders, the large-spot cohort survived 4 times better than the small-spot cohort. In the large-flounder-only treatment, small spot survived 2.4 times better than large spot. When both large and small southern flounders were present, large spot had a net advantage, exceeding small spot survival by 2.4 times. We developed an individual-based model of the flounder--spot size-dependent predation interaction based on data from independent laboratory observations on size-based prey profitability, and used it to simulate the results of our experimental treatments. Model predictions of spot survival and size distributions agreed well with the pond experimental results when encounter rates were assumed to scale with spot size and density and with southern flounder density.},

  abstract = {How ecological communities react to species extinctions is a long-standing yet current question in ecology. The species constituting the basic units of ecosystems interact with each other forming complex networks of trophic relationships and the characteristics of these networks are highly important for the consequences of species extinction. Here we take a more general approach and analyze a broad range of network characteristics and their role in determining food web susceptibility to secondary extinctions. We extend previous studies, that have focused on the consequences of topological and dynamical food web parameters for food web robustness, by also defining network-wide characteristics depending on the relationships between the distribution of species body masses and other species characteristics. We use a bioenergetic dynamical model to simulate realistically structured model food webs that differ in their structural and dynamical properties as well as their size structure. In order to measure food web robustness we calculated the proportion of species going secondarily extinct. A multiple regression analysis was then used to fit a general model relating the proportion of species going secondarily extinct to the measured food web properties. Our results show that there are multiple factors from all three groups of food web characteristics that affect food web robustness. However, we find the most striking effect was related to the body mass--abundance relationship which points to the importance of body mass relationships for food web stability. Zusammenfassung Die Frage nach den Konsequenzen des Artensterbens f{\"u}r {\"o}kologische Gemeinschaften ist eine aktuelle Frage, die {\"O}kologen seit langer Zeit besch{\"a}ftigt. Arten bilden die Grundeinheiten der {\"O}kosysteme: sie interagieren untereinander und bilden dadurch komplexe Netzwerke. Trophische Beziehungen innerhalb dieser Netzwerke und generelle Netzwerkeigenschaften sind entscheidend f{\"u}r die Folgen des Artensterbens. In dieser Studie besch{\"a}ftigen wir uns mit einem generellen Ansatz, um eine breite Palette von Netzwerkeigenschaften und deren Rolle f{\"u}r sekund{\"a}res Artensterben innerhalb von Nahrungsnetzen zu analysieren. Vorherige Studien besch{\"a}ftigten sich entweder mit topologischen Parametern oder simulierten dynamisch kleinere Nahrungsnetz-Modulen. Unsere Studie kombiniert beide Ans{\"a}tze und erweitert das Modell um die Abh{\"a}ngigkeit der Parameter von K{\"o}rpermassen. Wir benutzen dabei ein bioenergetisches Modell und simulieren realistisch strukturierte Nahrungsnetze. Dabei liegt der Fokus auf einer realistischen K{\"o}rpergr{\"o}{\ss}enverteilung der Arten, sowie auf realistischen Annahmen bez{\"u}glich struktureller, dynamischer Aspekte. Die Robustheit der Nahrungsnetze ist zu verstehen als der Anteil der sekund{\"a}ren Aussterbeereignisse, die ausgel{\"o}st werden durch das systematische prim{\"a}re Aussterben. Dabei wird nacheinander jeweils eine Art aus dem Netz entfernt, bis jede Art einmal entfernt wurde. Um den Einfluss einzelner Netzwerkfaktoren auf sekund{\"a}res Aussterben zu identifizieren, benutzten wir hier ein multiples Regressionsmodell. Es zeigt sich, dass Faktoren aus drei unterschiedlichen Gruppen (topologisch, dynamisch, allometrisch korreliert) die Robustheit von Nahrungsnetzen beeinflussen. Der Zusammenhang zwischen Abundanzen und K{\"o}rpermassen, der die Artgemeinschaften charakterisiert, zeigte interessanterweise den st{\"a}rksten Effekt auf die sekund{\"a}re Aussterberate.},

  abstract = {High rates of brood parasitism are generally associated with agricultural landscapes, but recent evidence suggests that urbanization may also increase the likelihood of brood parasitism. I evaluated the extent to which brood parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) was explained by differences in (1) body size of adult hosts, presumably relating to the ability to defend nest from cowbirds, (2) nest placement in substrate and relative to habitat edges, (3) habitat structure surrounding nests, (4) host density, (5) cowbird abundance, both absolute and relative to host numbers, (6) landscape composition, and (7) Julian date. From 2001 to 2006, I monitored nest fate and measured vegetation characteristics surrounding nests of Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) breeding in mature riparian forests in central Ohio, USA. The likelihood that a nest would be parasitized was best explained by the number of understory stems surrounding the nest and, to a lesser extent, by the amount of urbanization in the surrounding 1-km-radius landscape. Parasitized nests were surrounded by 1.6 times more stems and nearly twice the amount of urbanization than nonparasitized nests. Numbers of understory stems were positively associated with increasing urbanization, primarily due to invasion of urban forests by Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii). Thus, urban-associated changes in habitat characteristics around nests may be important contributors to the greater vulnerability of urban nests to brood parasitism than nests in more rural landscapes. This pattern suggests that ecological restoration, such as removing exotic shrubs, may be an effective strategy to ameliorate certain negative consequences of urbanization near wooded reserves.},

In an effort to understand the processes that govern an apparent avoidance of urban landscapes by many Nearctic--Neotropical migratory birds, we examined population- and individual-level responses of the Acadian flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) to urbanization within the landscapes surrounding 35 riparian forest stands in Ohio, USA. 2 From May to August 2001--06 we surveyed birds, banded 175 territorial flycatchers to estimate both condition and survival, tracked nest initiation dates, monitored success of 387 nests and estimated annual reproductive productivity of 163 breeding pairs. 3 Neither apparent annual survival of males ({$\varphi$} = 0{$\cdot$}53 {\textpm} 0{$\cdot$}056 SE) nor females ({$\varphi$} = 0{$\cdot$}23 {\textpm} 0{$\cdot$}064 SE) was related to the amount of urban development within the landscape. Similarly, daily survival rates of nests, which ranged from 0{$\cdot$}92 to 0{$\cdot$}98 across sites, was not associated significantly with urbanization. In contrast, reproductive productivity was related negatively to the amount of urbanization surrounding riparian forests, perhaps due in part to the greater incidence of brood parasitism and fewer numbers of nesting attempts made by pairs in urban compared to rural forests. 4 Forests within urban landscapes experienced higher levels of turnover in site occupancy, and birds settling in urban areas initiated nests later, had marginally smaller body sizes and exhibited lower return rates following nest predation than birds in more rural landscapes. In this way, behavioural processes governing habitat selection, settlement patterns and site fidelity probably contributed to the lower levels of reproductive productivity achieved by pairs nesting in urban landscapes. 5 This study provides evidence that the negative association between Acadian flycatchers and urbanization results from both population- and individual-level responses to urbanizing landscapes surrounding their riparian forest habitats.},

  abstract = {By disrupting the structure of native ant assemblages, invasive ants can have effects across trophic levels. Most studies to date, however, have focused on the impacts just two species (Linepithema humile and Solenopsis invicta). The impacts of many other invasive ant species on ecological processes in their introduced range are unknown. In this study we tested the hypothesis that the invasive ant Pachycondyla chinensis disrupts ant-seed dispersal mutualisms by displacing native ant species, especially the keystone mutualist Aphaenogaster rudis, while failing to disperse seeds itself. In a paired design we measured the impact of P. chinensis on the native ant-plant seed dispersal mutualism. The number of A. rudis workers was 96\% lower in invaded than in intact plots, and the number of seeds removed was 70\% lower in these plots. Finally, in invaded plots the abundance of Hexastylis arifolia, a locally abundant myrmecochorous plant, was 50\% lower than in plots where P. chinensis was absent. A parsimonious interpretation of our results is that P. chinensis causes precipitous declines in the abundance of A. rudis within invaded communities, thereby disrupting the ant-plant seed dispersal mutualisms and reducing abundances of ant-dispersed plants. In sum, the magnitude of the effects of P. chinensis on seed dispersal is quantitatively similar to that documented for the intensively studied invasive Argentine ant. We suggest that more studies on the impacts of less-studied invasive ant species on seed dispersal mutualisms may increase our knowledge of the effects of these invaders on ecosystem function.},

The effect of dispersal in a heterogeneous environment is to reduce the variance in the environmental fluctuations. How the subpopulations are connected with respect to dispersers may be the primary factor in determining the change in population size with changes in environmental fluctuations. Both the type of dispersal pattern and the number of subpopulations may influence the persistence of a population without affecting the mean subpopulation size. Finally, it is noted that the ``value'' of a dispersal pattern changes with changes in parameter values and a shift from one parameter value to another may lead to a qualitative change in the type of dispersal pattern ``favoured''.},

  abstract = {Many pterygote (winged) insects have secondarily become flightless; why has this occurred? In this paper I test for an association between the frequency of flightlessness and (1) environmental heterogeneity, (2) geographic variables, (3) gender, (4) alternate modes of migration, and (5) taxonomic variation. Various authors have predicted that decreased environmental heterogeneity will favor the evolution of flightlessness. This hypothesis is consistent with a number of studies on the variation of wing dimorphism and flightlessness and with data analyzed in the present paper on the relationship between habitat type and wing morph in the North American Orthoptera. The incidence of flightlessness is also exceptionally high in woodlands, deserts, on the ocean surface, in specific habitats on the seashore (dunes and rock crevices but not the foreshore), in aquatic habitats, in the winter months, in hymenopteran and termite nests, and among ectoparasites of endotherms and parasites of arthropods. It is low in habitats bordering rivers, streams, ponds, etc. and in arboreal habitats. Some of these habitats can be classified as persistent, but others cannot be so designated or are too vaguely defined. The incidence of flightlessness increases with altitude and latitude but, contrary to 'conventional' wisdom, it is not exceptionally high on oceanic islands compared to mainland areas. Several authors have hypothesized that the clinal variation in flightlessness is a consequence of clinal variation in habitat persistence. Though the available data are consistent with this hypothesis, other factors such as impairment of flight by low temperatures cannot be rejected, though considered unlikely. Flightlessness is more frequent than expected by chance among parthenogenetic species and more frequent among females than males. Furthermore, there is a significant negative association between female mobility and flightlessness in males. I suggest that loss of flight is favored in females because it permits greater allocation of resources to egg production, but that flight is retained in males because it increases the probability of finding a mate. In some species alternate modes of migration, viz phoresy and ballooning, have evolved. Phoretic transport (i.e., via other animal species) may be important in those species in which it occurs, but it appears to have evolved relatively rarely. Among the Insecta ballooning occurs only in the larvae of Lepidoptera. Aptery (winglessness) is unusually frequent among Lepidoptera that eclose in the fall and winter months and live in woodlands and forests. I hypothesize that larval migration by ballooning, the large---scale spatiotemporal stability of woodlands, and the small---scale unpredictability of spring bud burst are primary factors favoring the evolution of flightlessness in these Lepidoptera. The mode of metamorphosis is correlated with the frequency of flightlessness; hemimetabolous and holometabolous insects are rarely flightless, while it is common among paurometabolous insects. Two factors that may favor such an association are differences in relative mobility of the larvae and niche shifts between the adult and larval stage. In the holometabolous insects taxonomic families with at least one flightless species have more species than those with only winged species. A possible explanation for this is that the occurrence of the appropriate ecological conditions favoring flightlessness in holometabolous insects and the requisite mutations are both very rare events.},

The spectacular evolution of male genitalia that impose physical injury on females during mating has often been suggested to be a product of sexually antagonistic coevolution, but our understanding of these extraordinary adaptations is very limited, and there are no direct data addressing their evolutionary elaboration. We show that more spiny male genitalia causes more harm to females during copulation and provide comparative evidence for the correlated evolution between these antagonistic adaptations in males and a female counteradaptation (the amount of connective tissue in the copulatory duct) in a group of insects. By combining comparative and experimental methods, we demonstrate that imbalance of relative armament of the sexes affects evolution of the economics of reproduction: as males evolve genitalia that are more harmful relative to the level of female counteradaptation, costs associated with mating for females increase and population fitness is depressed. Our results unveil a coevolutionary arms race between the sexes and are consistent with a proposed link between sexual conflict, species' viability, and the risk of extinction.},

In a mate-choice experiment the males spent more time with females with few or no black spots than with females with many black spots. This result was obtained in experiments with natural variation in parasite load, and also in experiments in which black spots were manipulated using tattoo ink. This suggests that males discriminate against parasitized females by using visual cues. In another choice experiment, males did not show any preference between males with or without black spots, suggesting that the discrimination occurs only in a sexual context. There was a negative correlation between parasite load and female fecundity. As a result, males mating with unparasitized females may benefit directly by fertilizing more eggs.},

However, the rapid spread of the fungal disease dogwood anthracnose (Discula destructiva Redlin) has caused extensive mortality of dogwoods throughout the Appalachians. We examined the impacts of dogwood anthracnose on the production of inflorescences by flowering dogwoods in western North Carolina as an indication of fruit production. We also collected ripe fruits in the fall, weighed the pulps and analyzed them for protein, lipids, Ca, K, Mg and P. Only one-third of 173 live trees flowered. Large trees were significantly more likely to flower than small trees, and as disease severity increased, the probability of flowering decreased. Neither the mean number of inflorescences per tree nor mean pulp weight differed among two size classes or three disease categories of trees. However, pulps from moderately infected trees contained significantly more Ca and P than pulps from lightly infected trees. Pulps from severely infected trees also contained higher levels of Ca than pulps from lightly diseased trees. A discriminant function analysis examining all six nutritional variables separated lightly diseased pulps from the other two categories along an axis represented by Ca, P and lipids. Moderately diseased pulps were separated from severely diseased pulps by K, P and protein. The most significant impact of dogwood anthracnose on frugivores will likely be the loss of flowering dogwoods from the landscape, with the concomitant loss of actual and potential fruit production.},

Currently we have little understanding of both the causes of this variation and its evolutionary consequences for other life-history traits. We examine how different levels of spatial structure affect the evolution of cannibalism and how cannibalism in turn drives the evolution of dispersal. Using pair approximations and simulations, we show that cannibalism can easily evolve in spatially structured populations as long as some dispersal exists. Furthermore, for a wide range of intermediate levels of spatial structure, we find the possibility of evolutionary branching leading to polymorphism in cannibalism. We also show that cannibalism itself can have important evolutionary consequences and select for increased dispersal rates, thus helping to determine the spatial structure of populations. The coevolution of cannibalism and dispersal results in the evolution of various alternative life-history strategies with different dispersal and cannibalism regimes. Which strategy evolves depends on the environmental conditions that determine initial cannibalism rates. Our results therefore suggest that differences in spatial structure could explain variation in the propensity for cannibalism and cannibalistic polyphenism. Furthermore, results emphasize that cannibalism can drive the evolution of other life-history traits and determine the spatial structure of natural populations.},

  abstract = {Nonlethal indirect interactions between predators often lead to nonadditive effects of predator number on prey survival and growth. Previous studies have focused on systems with at least two different predator species and one prey species. However, most predators undergo extreme ontological changes in phenotype such that interactions between different-sized cohorts of a predator and its prey could lead to nonadditive effects in systems with only two species. This may be important since different-sized individuals of the same species can differ more in their ecology than similar-sized individuals of different species. This study examined trait-mediated indirect effects in a two-species system including a cannibalistic predator with different-sized cohorts and its prey. I tested for these effects using larvae of two stream salamanders, Gyrinophilus porphyriticus (predator) and Eurycea cirrigera (prey), by altering the densities and combinations of predator size classes in experimental streams. Results showed that the presence of large individuals can significantly reduce the impact of density changes of smaller conspecifics on prey survival through nonlethal means. In the absence of large conspecifics, an increase in the relative frequency of small predators significantly increased predation rates, thereby reducing prey survival. However, with large conspecifics present, increasing the density of small predators did not decrease prey survival, resulting in a 14.3\% lower prey mortality than predicted from the independent effects of both predator size classes. Small predators changed their microhabitat use in the presence of larger conspecifics. Prey individuals reduced activity in response to large predators but did not respond to small predators. Both predators reduced prey growth. These results demonstrate that the impact of a predator can be significantly altered by two different types of trait-mediated indirect effects in two-species systems: between different-sized cohorts and between different cohorts and prey. This study demonstrates that predictions based on simple numerical changes that assume independent effects of different size classes or ignore size structure can be strongly misleading. We need to account for the size structure within predator populations in order to predict how changes in predator abundance will affect predator--prey dynamics.},

As strain CWBI-2.3T ({$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}LMG 25624T{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}DSM 23270T) was the first R-type symbiont to be isolated and characterized, it was designated as the type strain of Serratia symbiotica sp. nov.},

  abstract = {An improved technique was developed to assay the toxicity of insecticides against aphids using an artificial diet. The susceptibility of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) (Hemiptera: Aphidoidea) was determined for a selection of novel biorational insecticides, each representing a novel mode of action. Flonicamid, a novel systemic insecticide with selective activity as feeding blocker against sucking insects, showed high toxicity against first-instar A. pisum nymphs with an LC50 of 20.4 {$\mu$}g/ml after 24 h, and of 0.24 {$\mu$}g/ml after 72 h. The toxicity was compared with another feeding blocker, pymetrozine, and the neonicotinoid, imidacloprid. In addition, four insect growth regulators were tested. The chitin synthesis inhibitor flufenoxuron, the juvenile hormone analogue pyriproxyfen, and the azadirachtin compound Neem Azal-T/S showed strong effects and reduced the aphid population by 50\% after 3 days of treatment at a concentration of 7--9 {$\mu$}g/ml. The ecdysone agonist tested, halofenozide, was less potent. In conclusion, the improved aphid feeding apparatus can be useful as a miniature screening device for insecticides against different aphid pests. The present study demonstrated rapid and strong toxicity of flonicamid, and other biorational insecticides towards A. pisum.},

However, current theory suggests that cannibalism generally impedes disease spread, because each victim is usually consumed by a single cannibal, such that cannibalism does not function as a spreading process. Consequently, cannibalism cannot be the only mode of transmission of most parasites. We develop simple, but general epidemiological models to analyze the interaction of cannibalism and vertical transmission. We show that cannibalism increases the prevalence of vertically transmitted pathogens whenever the host population density is not solely regulated by cannibalism. This mechanism, combined with additional, recently published, theoretical mechanisms, presents a strong case for the role of cannibalism in the spread of infectious diseases across a wide range of parasite--host systems.},

This study identified a ranking of the importance of drivers of change, a ranking of the biomes with respect to expected changes, and the major sources of uncertainties. For terrestrial ecosystems, land-use change probably will have the largest effect, followed by climate change, nitrogen deposition, biotic exchange, and elevated carbon dioxide concentration. For freshwater ecosystems, biotic exchange is much more important. Mediterranean climate and grassland ecosystems likely will experience the greatest proportional change in biodiversity because of the substantial influence of all drivers of biodiversity change. Northern temperate ecosystems are estimated to experience the least biodiversity change because major land-use change has already occurred. Plausible changes in biodiversity in other biomes depend on interactions among the causes of biodiversity change. These interactions represent one of the largest uncertainties in projections of future biodiversity change.},

However, to date most predictions are based on niche (bioclimatic) models that usually overlook biotic interactions, behavioral adjustments or adaptive evolution and assume that species can disperse freely without constraints. The deep subterranean environment minimises these uncertainties, as it is simple, homogeneous and with constant environmental conditions. It is thus an ideal model system to study the effect of global change in species with poor dispersal capabilities. We assess the potential fate of a lineage of troglobitic beetles under global change predictions using different approaches to estimate their thermal niche: bioclimatic models, rates of thermal niche change estimated from a molecular phylogeny and data from physiological studies. Using bioclimatic models, at most 60\% of the species were predicted to have suitable conditions in 2080. Considering the rates of thermal niche change did not improve this prediction. However, physiological data suggest that subterranean species have a broad thermal tolerance, allowing them to stand temperatures never experienced through their evolutionary history. These results stress the need of experimental approaches to assess the capability of poor dispersal species to cope with temperatures outside those they currently experience.},

While human activities can be the direct cause of some extinctions, it is becoming increasingly clear that species extinctions themselves can be the cause of further extinctions, since species affect each other through the network of ecological interactions among them. There is concern that the simplification of ecosystems, due to the loss of species and ecological interactions, increases their vulnerability to such secondary extinctions. It is predicted that more complex food webs will be less vulnerable to secondary extinctions due to greater trophic redundancy that can buffer against the effects of species loss. Here, we demonstrate in a field experiment with replicated plant-insect communities, that the probability of secondary extinctions is indeed smaller in food webs that include trophic redundancy. Harvesting one species of parasitoid wasp led to secondary extinctions of other, indirectly linked, species at the same trophic level. This effect was markedly stronger in simple communities than for the same species within a more complex food web. We show that this is due to functional redundancy in the more complex food webs and confirm this mechanism with a food web simulation model by highlighting the importance of the presence and strength of trophic links providing redundancy to those links that were lost. Our results demonstrate that biodiversity loss, leading to a reduction in redundant interactions, can increase the vulnerability of ecosystems to secondary extinctions, which, when they occur, can then lead to further simplification and run-away extinction cascades.},

  abstract = {All free-living animals are subject to intense selection pressure from parasites and pathogens resulting in behavioural adaptations that can help potential hosts to avoid falling prey to parasites. This special issue on the evolution of parasite avoidance behaviour was compiled following a Royal Society meeting in 2017. Here we have assembled contributions from a wide range of disciplines including genetics, ecology, parasitology, behavioural science, ecology, psychology and epidemiology on the disease avoidance behaviour of a wide range of species. Taking an interdisciplinary and cross-species perspective allows us to sketch out the strategies, mechanisms and consequences of parasite avoidance and to identify gaps and further questions. Parasite avoidance strategies must include avoiding parasites themselves and cues to their presence in conspecifics, heterospecifics, foods and habitat. Further, parasite avoidance behaviour can be directed at constructing parasite-retardant niches. Mechanisms of parasite avoidance behaviour are generally less well characterized, though nematodes, rodents and human studies are beginning to elucidate the genetic, hormonal and neural architecture that allows animals to recognize and respond to cues of parasite threat. While the consequences of infection are well characterized in humans, we still have much to learn about the epidemiology of parasites of other species, as well as the trade-offs that hosts make in parasite defence versus other beneficial investments like mating and foraging. Finally, in this overview we conclude that it is legitimate to use the word `disgust' to describe parasite avoidance systems, in the same way that `fear' is used to describe animal predator avoidance systems. Understanding disgust across species offers an excellent system for investigating the strategies, mechanisms and consequences of behaviour and could be a vital contribution towards the understanding and conservation of our planet's ecosystems.

  abstract = {Maximum isometric force output by single muscles has long been known to be proportional to muscle mass0.67, i.e to muscle cross-sectional area. However, locomotion often requires a different muscle contraction regime than that used under isometric conditions. Moreover, lever mechanisms generally affect the force outputs of muscle--limb linkages, which is one reason why the scaling of net force output by intact musculoskeletal systems can differ from mass0.67. Indeed, several studies have demonstrated that force output by intact musculoskeletal systems and non-biological systems is proportional to motor mass1.0. Here we trace the mechanisms that cause dragonflies to achieve a change from muscle mass0.67 scaling of maximum force output by single flight muscles to mass1.0 scaling of dynamic force output by the intact dragonfly flight motor. In eight species of dragonflies, tetanic force output by the basalar muscle during isometric contraction scaled as muscle mass0.67. Mean force output by the basalar muscle under dynamic conditions (workloops) that simulated in vivo maximum musculoskeletal performance was proportional to muscle mass0.83, a significant increase in the scaling exponent over that of maximum isometric force output. The dynamic performance of the basalar muscle and the anatomy of its lever, consisting of the second moment of area of the forewing (d2) and the distance between the muscle apodeme and the wing fulcrum (d1), were used to analyze net force output by the integrated muscle-lever system(Find). The scaling of d2 conformed closely to the expected value from geometic similarity (proportional to muscle mass0.31), whereas d1 scaled as muscle mass0.54, a significant increase over the expected value from geometric similarity. Find scaled as muscle mass1.036, and this scaling exponent was not significantly different from unity or from the scaling exponent relating maximum load-lifting by flying dragonflies to their thorax mass. Thus, the combined effect of a change in the scaling of force output by the muscle during dynamic contraction compared to that during isometric contraction and the departure from geometric similarity of one of the two lever arm lengths provides an explanation for how mass1.0 scaling of force output by the intact musculoskeletal system is accomplished. We also show that maximum muscle mass-specific net work and power output available scale as mass0.43 and mass0.24, respectively.},

  abstract = {One of the most pervasive themes in ecology is that biological diversity stabilizes ecosystem processes and the services they provide to society, a concept that has become a common argument for biodiversity conservation. Species-rich communities are thought to produce more temporally stable ecosystem services because of the complementary or independent dynamics among species that perform similar ecosystem functions. Such variance dampening within communities is referred to as a portfolio effect and is analogous to the effects of asset diversity on the stability of financial portfolios. In ecology, these arguments have focused on the effects of species diversity on ecosystem stability but have not considered the importance of biologically relevant diversity within individual species. Current rates of population extirpation are probably at least three orders of magnitude higher than species extinction rates, so there is a pressing need to clarify how population and life history diversity affect the performance of individual species in providing important ecosystem services. Here we use five decades of data from Oncorhynchus nerka (sockeye salmon) in Bristol Bay, Alaska, to provide the first quantification of portfolio effects that derive from population and life history diversity in an important and heavily exploited species. Variability in annual Bristol Bay salmon returns is 2.2 times lower than it would be if the system consisted of a single homogenous population rather than the several hundred discrete populations it currently consists of. Furthermore, if it were a single homogeneous population, such increased variability would lead to ten times more frequent fisheries closures. Portfolio effects are also evident in watershed food webs, where they stabilize and extend predator access to salmon resources. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of maintaining population diversity for stabilizing ecosystem services and securing the economies and livelihoods that depend on them. The reliability of ecosystem services will erode faster than indicated by species loss alone.},

Although the negative impacts of invasives on native plant communities are well documented, effects on forest bird communities remain largely unknown. To address this issue, we examined the response of avian communities to invasive plants in forest fragments across 4 counties in northeastern Illinois, a region characterized by extensive urbanization. We surveyed breeding bird communities in 46 forest plots representing a gradient in abundance of invasive woody plants. We quantified vegetation structure and composition within plots, as well as landscape context. Exotic trees and shrubs were present on all but 3 plots. Although native trees were common, native species represented \&lt;7\% of total stem density of shrubs. Measures of invasion were weakly correlated with those representing urbanization, yet broad-scale measures of urbanization such as building density and urban cover were strongly associated with avian community structure. At finer scales, measures of invasion were important predictors of the relative abundance of birds in several nesting and foraging guilds. Shrub nesters showed a positive response to invasive vegetation, whereas the relative abundance of aerial salliers and ground nesters decreased with increased proportions of invasive trees. Because restoration strategies aimed at the complete removal of invasive shrubs could diminish habitat quality for some species, thinning of understory vegetation or the removal of invasive trees may confer the greatest benefits to avian communities when few native understory plants are present.},

As temperature increases, the rate of metabolism increases and then rapidly declines at higher temperatures -- a response that can be described using a thermal performance curve (TPC). Although the shape of the TPC for aerobic metabolism is often attributed to the competing effects of thermodynamics, which can be described using the Arrhenius equation, and the effects of temperature on protein stability, this account represents an over-simplification of the factors acting even at the level of single proteins. In addition, it cannot adequately account for the effects of temperature on complex multistep processes, such as aerobic metabolism, that rely on mechanisms acting across multiple levels of biological organization. The purpose of this review is to explore our current understanding of the factors that shape the TPC for aerobic metabolism in response to acute changes in temperature, and to highlight areas where this understanding is weak or insufficient. Developing a more strongly grounded mechanistic model to account for the shape of the TPC for aerobic metabolism is crucial because these TPCs are the foundation of several recent attempts to predict the responses of species to climate change, including the metabolic theory of ecology and the hypothesis of oxygen and capacity-limited thermal tolerance.},

Tadpole body size had a dramatic effect on survival; large tadpoles had higher survival than medium-sized or small tadpoles. The presence of tail injury simulating an unsuccessful predation attempt significantly reduced survival. Survival of control tadpoles without tail injury in the presence of a predator was almost twice as high as that of tadpoles with 75\% tail loss. Tadpole sibship had no effect on survival and indicated that genetic differences in antipredator behavior or production of alarm substances and allelochemicals, independent of body size, were not apparent. There were no significant interactions between tail injury and body size or tail injury and sibship. These results indicate that increasing body size is an effective mechanism for reducing predation and that injury from an unsuccessful predation attempt reduces subsequent survival by increasing the risk of future predation.},

We investigated the effects of sexual selection and fecundity selection on the sizes of males and females, respectively, in American rubyspots, Hetaerina americana. Males are larger than females and have large red spots at the base of each wing that are sexually selected via male--male contests. Mating success is determined by the ownership of a territory. Large males held territories for longer and sustained longer territorial fights than small males. Territorial males obtained more copulations than nonterritorial ones. Large males also had more wing pigmentation and mated with large females. Large territorial males had high energy reserves, whereas nonterritorial males appeared to have depleted reserves. Selection analyses of body size showed disruptive selection acting on male body size, suggesting that both small and large males may be favoured in terms of mating success. We also tested whether fecundity selection acts on female size. However, female body size was unrelated to the number of eggs carried. Taken together, our results suggest that in this territorial damselfly species male-biased size dimorphism is driven by large male size in male--male competition being selectively advantageous in territory acquisition and/or maintenance. We also suggest that small size is advantageous in nonterritorial males to improve their agility in courting (or subduing) females.},

  abstract = {The conversion of Earth's land surface to urban uses is one of the most irreversible human impacts on the global biosphere. It drives the loss of farmland, affects local climate, fragments habitats, and threatens biodiversity. Here we present a meta-analysis of 326 studies that have used remotely sensed images to map urban land conversion. We report a worldwide observed increase in urban land area of 58,000 km2 from 1970 to 2000. India, China, and Africa have experienced the highest rates of urban land expansion, and the largest change in total urban extent has occurred in North America. Across all regions and for all three decades, urban land expansion rates are higher than or equal to urban population growth rates, suggesting that urban growth is becoming more expansive than compact. Annual growth in GDP per capita drives approximately half of the observed urban land expansion in China but only moderately affects urban expansion in India and Africa, where urban land expansion is driven more by urban population growth. In high income countries, rates of urban land expansion are slower and increasingly related to GDP growth. However, in North America, population growth contributes more to urban expansion than it does in Europe. Much of the observed variation in urban expansion was not captured by either population, GDP, or other variables in the model. This suggests that contemporary urban expansion is related to a variety of factors difficult to observe comprehensively at the global level, including international capital flows, the informal economy, land use policy, and generalized transport costs. Using the results from the global model, we develop forecasts for new urban land cover using SRES Scenarios. Our results show that by 2030, global urban land cover will increase between 430,000 km2 and 12,568,000 km2, with an estimate of 1,527,000 km2 more likely.},

  abstract = {Movement is a widespread behavior across organisms and is driven in part by interspecific interactions. Generally, negative interspecific interactions (such as competition and natural enemies) are more often studied in the context of movement than positive interactions (mutualism). Mutualistic relationships are incredibly common, yet only a subset are studied in the context of movement (transportation mutualisms). Overall, the costs and benefits that an individual experiences are shaped both by their movement behavior and their mutualistic relationships, as well as the intersection between these. Here we argue that the intersection between movement behavior and mutualistic relationships is understudied, and we present a conceptual framework to synthesize the links between movement and mutualisms and give examples of species that exhibit each. Our framework serves both to highlight the ways that mutualism can shape movement (and vice versa) and to draw parallels across different organisms (enabling a more abstract perspective of these biological systems, complementing the system-focused perspective). Finally, we show how considering movement in light of mutualisms (and vice versa) presents a number of new research questions to be answered by each empirical and theoretical approach going forward.},

  abstract = {Although dispersal requires context-dependent decision-making in three distinct stages (emigration, transit, immigration), these decisions are commonly ignored in simple models of dispersal. For sexually reproducing organisms, mate availability is an important factor in dispersal decisions. Difficulty finding mates can lead to an Allee effect where population growth decreases at low densities. Surprisingly, theoretical studies on mate finding and on sex-biased dispersal produce opposing predictions: in the former, one sex is predicted to move less if the other sex evolves to search more, whereas in the latter, mate-finding difficulties can select for less sex bias in dispersal when mate finding occurs after dispersal. Here, we develop a pair of models to examine the joint evolution of dispersal and settlement behaviour. Our first model resolves the apparent contradiction from the mate search and dispersal literatures. Our second model demonstrates that the relationship between mating system and sex-biased dispersal is more complex than a simple contrast between resource defence monogamy and female defence polygyny. Our results highlight that a key factor is the timing of mating relative to dispersal (before, during, or after). We also show that although movement has the potential to alleviate a mate-finding Allee effect, in some cases, it can actually exacerbate the effect.},

  abstract = {Migration, a widespread animal behavior, can influence how individuals acquire and transmit pathogens. Past work has demonstrated that migration can reduce the costs of pathogen or parasite infection through two processes: migratory escape from infected areas or individuals and migratory culling of infected individuals. Here, we propose a third process: migratory recovery, where infected individuals lose their parasites and recover from infection during migration. Recovery can occur when parasites and/or their intermediate hosts cannot support changes in the migratory host's internal or external environment during migration. Thus, parasite mortality increases with migration. Although migratory recovery is likely widespread across species, it remains challenging to empirically test it as a selective force promoting migration. We develop a model and determine the conditions under which migratory recovery theoretically favors the evolution of migration. We show that incorporating migratory recovery into a model of migratory escape increases the range of biologically realistic conditions favoring migration and leads to scenarios where partial migration can evolve. Motivated by empirical estimates of infection costs, our model shows how recovery from infection could drive the evolution of migration. We suggest a number of future directions for both theoretical and empirical research in this area.},

  abstract = {Achieving sufficient connectivity between populations is essential for persistence, but costs of dispersal may select against individual traits or behaviours that, if present, would improve connectivity. Existing dispersal models tend to ignore the multitude of risks to individuals: while many assess the effect of mortality costs, there is also a risk of failing to find new habitat, especially when the entire inhabitable area remains both small and fragmented. There are few known rules governing whether individuals evolve to disperse more, or less, than what is ideal for population connectivity and persistence. Here we aim to fill this gap, while also noting that evolution might not only produce suboptimal dispersal behaviour: it also influences individual heterogeneity in dispersal. Intuitively, we might expect heterogeneity to improve connectivity, as some individuals will travel far. However, we show that this is only true if dispersal distances on average are quite short; heterogeneity can also lead to reduced connectivity because it can reduce the proportion of the most profitable (`safest') intermediate dispersal distances. In general, our results show that conditions typically associated with conservation concerns (small and fragmented habitats inhabited by a species with a low birth rate) are also ones that are most likely to lead to suboptimal dispersal traits. This prompts the question of assisted dispersal in cases of urgent conservation concern.},

  abstract = {Field and laboratory experiments demonstrated that the degree to which an aquatic insects, Notonecta hoffmanni, shows avoidance behavior towards an important predator is proportional to the magnitude of the risk of predation. Laboratory experiments showed that I, II, and III instar juvenile N. hoffmanni can suffer significant mortality due to predation from adult N. hoffmanni whereas IV and V instars suffered no mortality from adults. In particular, the relative risk of predation from adults was I {$>$} II {$>$} III {$>$} IV = V {$^\circ$} no risk. Based on these data I predicted that I, II, and III instars should avoid adults whereas IV and V instars should not, and that the relative degee of avoidance should be I {$>$} II {$>$} III {$>$} IV = V {$^\circ$} no avoidance. Two measures of predator avoidance were documented: alterations in the use of space, and reductions in movement. In both the laboratory and the field the effects of adults on the behavior of juvenile notonectids were determined by comparing the juvenile's behavior when adults were experimentally removed to that in controls where adults were present. Alterations in spatial patterns were as predicted, i.e., in both the laboratory and the field only I, II, and III instars avoided adults by altering their use of space, and the degree to which spatial patterns were altered was highly correlated with the relative risk of predation. In the laborabory, reductions in movement were also as predicted, i.e., only I, II, and III instars reduced their movement in the presence of adults and the reductions in movement was highly correlated with the risk of predation. However, in the field, only I and III instars avoided adults by moving less; i.e., II instars did not conform to expectations. Accordingly, in the field the correlation between the reduction in movement and the risk of predation was positive but not significant. In the laboratory, the effects of adults on juvenile feeding rates were also documented. Because I and II instars avoided adults by altering their spatial and movement patterns, they suffered a cost in reduced feeding rates. Unexpectedly, III instars altered their feeding behaviors but suffered no reduction in feeding rats. Partial correlation analysis showed that a decrease in the juvenile's use of the central region of water bodies (where prey were four times more dense) resulted in a significant decrease in their feeding rates, but that a reduction in their movement had no such effect. I then discuss the effects on the predictions of optimal foraging theory of some common mechanisms by which notonectids avoid their predators. Because the degree of avoidance is related to the risk of predation I also discuss the possibility that feeding behavior represents an adaptive compromise between the conflicting demands of feeding efficiently and avoiding predators. Finally, because the avoidance of predation reduces both the feeding rate of predators on foragers and of foragers on prey, I examine the effects of such reductions on population interactions among predators, foragers, and prey.},

  abstract = {A recent model, designed with stream systems in mind, suggested that prey exchange (movement of prey among patches) tends to reduce predator impacts on prey density; that is, rapid prey immigration into a patch with predators can swamp local effects of predators on prey density. The previous model, however, included two assumptions that influence the model's qualitative predictions. First, it assumed that the system's focal patches are surrounded by an environment that has no predators and a constant prey density. More importantly, it assumed that prey do not alter their per capita emigration rates in response to the presence of predators. We extended the earlier model by relaxing these assumptions. Specifically, we: (1) addressed predator impacts in patches surrounded by background environments that do not have predators, (2) allowed the background environment to have a constant or decreasing prey density (i.e., we examined situations in which predators deplete prey), and (3) accounted for the fact that prey per capita emigration rates are often altered by the presence of predators. Our most interesting results concerned the profound effects of prey emigration behavior on the relationship between prey exchange and predator impact. If prey do not alter their emigration rates in response to predators, then, as predicted by the earlier model, high prey exchange should result in very low predator impact. If, however, prey disperse out of patches in response to the presence of predators (i.e., if prey per capita emigration rates are higher out of patches with predators than out of predator---free patches), then even very high prey exchange rates cannot swamp predator impact; instead, prey emigration adds to predator impact. Thus, depending on prey emigration behavior, increased overall prey exchange can either decrease or increase predator impact. Predators can also suppress prey emigration (e.g., if prey hide in refuges so effectively that they disperse at low rates from predator patches). In that case, high prey exchange rates tend to result in ``negative predator impacts'' (i.e., higher prey density in patches with predators). The details of the above relationships are influenced by whether or not the background environment has predators. If the background has predators, but predators do not deplete prey (e.g., if predation is offset by recruitment), then predator impact depends only on the ratio of per capita emigration rates out of predator and predator---free patches; that is, attack rates do not influence impact. In contrast, if predators can deplete prey, then attack rates influence predator impact. In that situation, if attack rates are highly relative to prey emigration rates out of predator---free patches, then predator impact steadily increases over time. A literature review suggested that prey alterations in per capita emigration rates in response to the presence of predators can potentially explain some surprising natural phenonomena, including the existence of ``negative predator impacts,'' and the apparent tendency for invertebrate predators (primarily, stoneflies) to have stronger impacts, and the apparent tendency for vertebrate predators (primarily, fish). Finally, we discussed possible adaptive links between prey escape success, refuge use, dispersal behavior, and predator impacts. This discussion raised a ``paradox of danger'' that due to their effects on prey exchange, more dangerous predators might often have unexpectedly weak effects on local prey density. In this context, we suggest a framework for studying relationships between prey behavior, prey exchange, and predator impacts.},

  abstract = {Explanations for rapid species' range expansions have typically been purely ecological, with little attention given to evolutionary processes. We tested predictions for the evolution of dispersal during range expansion using four species of wing-dimorphic bush cricket (Conocephalus discolor, Conocephalus dorsalis, Metrioptera roeselii, and Metrioptera brachyptera). We observed distinct changes in dispersal in the two species with expanding ranges. Recently colonized populations at the range margin showed increased frequencies of dispersive, long-winged (macropterous) individuals, compared with longer-established populations in the range core. This increase in dispersal appeared to be short-lived because 5--10 years after colonization populations showed similar incidences of macroptery to populations in the range core. These changes are consistent with evolutionary change; field patterns persisted when nymphs were reared under controlled environmental conditions, and range margin individuals reared in the laboratory flew farther than range core individuals in a wind tunnel. There was also a reproductive trade-off with dispersal in both females and males, which could explain the rapid reversion to lower rates of dispersal once populations become established. The effect of population density on wing morphology differed between populations from the range core (no significant effect of density) and expanding range margins (negative density dependence), which we propose is part of the mechanism of the changes in dispersal. Transient changes in dispersal are likely to be common in many species undergoing range expansion and can have major population and biogeographic consequences.},

Legumes (Fabaceae) are a diverse and widely distributed plant family largely dependent on symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia, which are acquired from soil after germination. This dependency is predicted to limit establishment in new geographic areas, owing to a disruption of compatible host-symbiont associations. Here we compare non-native establishment patterns of symbiotic and non-symbiotic legumes across over 3,500 species, covering multiple independent gains and losses of rhizobial symbiosis. We find that symbiotic legume species have spread to fewer non-native regions compared to non-symbiotic legumes, providing strong support for the hypothesis that lack of suitable symbionts or environmental conditions required for effective nitrogen-fixation are driving these global introduction patterns. These results highlight the importance of mutualisms in predicting non-native species establishment and the potential impacts of microbial biogeography on global plant distributions.},

  abstract = {The response of individual species to climate change may alter the composition and dynamics of communities. Here, we show that the impacts of environmental change on communities can depend on the nature of the interspecific interactions: mutualistic communities typically respond differently than commensalistic or parasitic communities. We model and analyse the geographic range shifting of metapopulations of two interacting species -- a host and an obligate species. Different types of interspecific interactions are implemented by modifying local extinction rates according to the presence/absence of the other species. We distinguish and compare three fundamentally different community types: mutualism, commensalism and parasitism. We find that community dynamics during geographic range shifting critically depends on the type of interspecific interactions. Parasitic interactions exacerbate the negative effect of environmental change whereas mutualistic interactions only partly compensate it. Commensalistic interactions exhibit an intermediate response. Based on these model outcomes, we predict that parasitic species interactions may be more vulnerable to geographic range shifting than commensalistic or mutualistic ones. However, we observe that when climate stabilises following a period of change, the rate of community recovery is largely independent of the type of interspecific interactions. These results emphasize that communities respond delicately to environmental change, and that local interspecific interactions can affect range shifting communities at large spatial scales.},

  abstract = {A shift in the relative arrival of offspring, for example a shift in hatching time, can affect competition at the intraspecific level through size-mediated priority effects, where the larger individuals gain more resources. These priority effects are likely to be affected by climate warming and the rate of intraspecific predation, that is cannibalism. In a laboratory experiment, we examined size-mediated priority effects in larvae of the univoltine damselfly, Lestes sponsa, at two different temperatures (21 and 23{$^\circ$}C). We created three size groups of larvae by manipulating hatching time: early hatched with a large size (extra-advanced), intermediate hatched with an intermediate size (advanced) and late hatched with a small size (non-advanced). Thereafter, we reared the larvae from these groups in non-mixed and mixed groups of 12 larvae. We found strong priority and temperature effects. First, extra-advanced larvae most often had higher survival, growth and development rates than non-advanced larvae in mixed groups, compared to groups that consisted of only extra-advanced larvae. Second, temperature increased growth and development rates and cannibalism. However, the strength of priority effects did not differ between the two experimental temperatures, because there was no statistical interaction between temperature and treatments. That is, the mixed and non-mixed groups of non-advanced, advanced and extra-advanced larvae showed the same relative change in life-history traits across the two temperatures. Non-advanced and advanced larvae had similar or higher growth rate and mass in mixed groups compared to non-mixed groups, suggesting that predation from advanced larvae in the mixed group released resources for the non-advanced and advanced larvae that survived despite cannibalism risk. Thus, a thinning effect occurred due to cannibalism caused by priority effects. The results suggest that a shift in the relative arrival of offspring can cause temperature-dependent priority effects, mediated through cannibalism, growth and development, which may change the size distribution and abundance of emerging aquatic insects.},

  abstract = {Wildlife has existed in urban areas since records began. However, the discipline of urban ecology is relatively new and one that is undergoing rapid growth. All wildlife in urban areas will interact with humans to some degree. With rates of urbanisation increasing globally, there is a pressing need to understand the type and nature of human--wildlife interactions within urban environments, to help manage, mitigate or even promote these interactions. Much research attention has focussed on the core topic of human--wildlife conflict. This inherent bias in the literature is probably driven by the ease with which it can be quantified and assessed. Human--wildlife conflicts in terms of disease transmission, physical attack and property damage are important topics to understand. Equally, the benefits of human--wildlife interactions are becoming increasingly recognised, despite being harder to quantify and generalise. Wildlife may contribute to the provision of ecosystem services in urban areas, and some recent work has shown how interactions with wildlife can provide a range of benefits to health and wellbeing. More research is needed to improve understanding in this area, requiring wildlife biologists to work with other disciplines including economics, public health, sociology, ethics, psychology and planning. There will always be a need to control wildlife populations in certain urban situations to reduce human--wildlife conflict. However, in an increasingly urbanised and resource-constrained world, we need to learn how to manage the risks from wildlife in new ways, and to understand how to maximise the diverse benefits that living with wildlife can bring.},

  abstract = {Mortality of animals on roads is a critical threat to many wildlife populations and is poised to increase strongly because of ongoing and planned road construction. If these new roads cannot be avoided, effective mitigation measures will be necessary to stop biodiversity decline. Fencing along roads effectively reduces roadkill and is often used in combination with wildlife passages. Because fencing the entire road is not always possible due to financial constraints, high-frequency roadkill areas are often identified to inform the placement of fencing. We devised an adaptive fence-implementation plan to prioritize road sections for fencing. In this framework, areas along roads of high, moderate, and low levels of animal mortality (respectively, roadkill hotspots, warmspots, and coldspots) are identified at multiple scales (i.e., in circles of different diameters [200--2000 m] in which mortality frequency is measured). Fence deployment is based on the relationship between the amount of fencing being added to the road, starting with the strongest roadkill hotspots, and potential reduction in road mortality (displayed in mortality-reduction graphs). We applied our approach to empirical and simulated spatial patterns of wildlife--vehicle collisions. The scale used for analysis affected the number and spatial extent of roadkill hot-, warm-, and coldspots. At fine scales (e.g., 200 m), more hotspots were identified than at coarse scales (e.g., 2000 m), but combined the fine-scale hotspots covered less road and less fencing was needed to reduce road mortality. However, many short fences may be less effective in practice due to a fence-end effect (i.e., animals moving around the fence more easily), resulting in a trade-off between few long and many short fences, which we call the FLOMS (few-long-or-many-short) fences trade-off. Thresholds in the mortality-reduction graphs occurred for some roadkill patterns, but not for others. Thresholds may be useful to consider when determining road-mitigation targets. The existence of thresholds at multiple scales and the FLOMS trade-off have important implications for biodiversity conservation.},

They can generate phenotypic polymorphisms that render it harder for a coevolving parasite or predator to exploit any one individual of a given species. In birds, egg polymorphisms should be an effective defense against mimetic brood parasites and are extreme in the African tawny-flanked prinia (Prinia subflava) and its parasite, the cuckoo finch (Anomalospiza imberbis). Here we use models of avian visual perception to analyze the appearance of prinia and cuckoo finch eggs from the same location over 40 years. We show that the two interacting populations have experienced rapid changes in egg traits. Egg colors of both species have diversified over time, expanding into avian color space as expected under negative frequency-dependent selection. Egg pattern showed signatures of both frequency-dependent and directional selection in different traits, which appeared to be evolving independently of one another. Host and parasite appear to be closely tracking one another's evolution, since parasites showed closer color mimicry of contemporaneous hosts. This correlational evidence suggests that hosts and parasites are locked in an ongoing arms race in egg appearance, driven by constant change in the selective advantage of different phenotypes, and that coevolutionary arms races can generate remarkably rapid phenotypic change.},

Two of the utilization efficiencies (approximate digestibility and efficiency of conversion of ingested food) were unaffected by temperature; the third one, efficiency of conversion of digested food, was affected by temperature but there was no consistent effect. Lower temperatures significantly increased the proportion of the stadium spent molting, with larvae at a daytime temperature of 20{$^\circ$} C spending 9\% more of the stadium in molting than larvae at 30{$^\circ$} C. Growth time was not influenced by nutrient concentration. When temperature was low and rutin absent, molt time and the proportion of the stadium spent molting were affected by nutrient concentration. Addition of the phenolic rutin did not have an appreciable effect on growth time or digestive processes. However, it increased molting time by 7 to 14\% and thus increased the duration of the stadium and reduced relative growth rate. These results indicate that the effect of food quality on growth rate is a function of the thermal conditions of insect herbivores. At cooler temperatures, a disproportionate increase in time spent molting, rather than altered food utilization efficiencies, contributed to lower growth rates. The consequences for larval growth of fluctuating temperatures due to diurnal cycles and the presence of predators forcing larvae into thermally suboptimal microhabitats are discussed.},

We tested the effect of rhizobia availability on plant growth by transplanting seed from three locations into five sites spanning C. fasciculata's range (interior, at the northern and western range edges, and beyond the range edges), and inoculating half the seeds with rhizobia. We recorded growth of all surviving plants, and, for the uninoculated plants, whether they had formed nodules or not. We isolated rhizobia from nodules collected on the uninoculated plants, and cross-inoculated seed from four populations (both range edge and interior populations) in the greenhouse to determine whether the quality of rhizobia differed between regions. We found that seeds transplanted beyond the range edge were less likely to be nodulated when they were not experimentally inoculated, and there was benefit to inoculation at all sites. In the greenhouse, the three inocula that formed nodules on plants, from the range interior, northern edge and beyond the northern edge, did not detectably differ in their effect on plant growth. These results suggest that low densities of suitable rhizobia beyond the range edge may limit range expansion of legume species.},

A major goal of this symposium is to broaden and shift this pairwise perspective and make it concordant with the emerging view that locally exclusive mutualisms between just two species are the exception and that many communities include guilds of mutualistic species on one or both sides of the interaction. Many pollination and seed-dispersal mutualisms have long been recognized as diffuse, but recent molecular analyses are revealing unrecognized partner diversity in mutualistic interactions previously thought to be locally species specific. Cooccurring species within a mutualist guild are unlikely to be ecologically equivalent in the way they locate, compete for, and/or reward partners, and so intraguild interactions have the potential to influence population dynamics and patterns of selection in species on both sides of the mutualistic interaction. To illustrate some of these potential complexities for population dynamics, I use simple path analytic models to show that positive pairwise interactions between mutualists do not necessarily translate into positive net interactions within a mutualism involving more than two species. For example, when there is intraguild competition for partners, or even for resources external to the mutualism, the presence of a lower-quality mutualist can negatively affect the partner population by reducing associations it can form with better mutualists. Variation in quality among potential partners is likely to place a premium on traits or behaviors that enhance association with better mutualists. More investigations are needed to determine how variation among interacting mutualists, with respect to characteristics such as longevity, dispersal capability, and competitive ability, influence population dynamics and selection in multispecies mutualisms.},

These interactions can be altered directly by changing consumption rates, or indirectly by altering growth rates and size asymmetries among individuals that in turn affect feeding. Understanding these processes is particularly important for intraspecific interactions, as direct and indirect changes may exacerbate antagonistic interactions. We examined the effect of temperature on activity rate, growth and intraspecific size asymmetries, and how these temperature dependencies affected cannibalism in Lestes congener, a damselfly with marked intraspecific variation in size. Temperature increased activity rates and exacerbated differences in body size by increasing growth rates. Increased activity and changes in body size interacted to increase cannibalism at higher temperatures. We argue that our results are likely to be general to species with life-history stages that vary in their temperature dependencies, and that the effects of climate change on communities may depend on the temperature dependencies of intraspecific interactions.},

  abstract = {The relationship between niche and distribution, and especially the role of biotic interactions in shaping species' geographic distributions, has gained increasing interest in the last two decades. Most ecological research has focused on negative species interactions, especially competition, predation and parasitism. Yet the relevance of positive interactions -- mutualisms and commensalisms -- have been brought to the fore in recent years by an increasing number of empirical studies exploring their impact on range limits. Based on a review of 73 studies from a Web of Science search, we found strong evidence that positive interactions can influence the extent of species' geographic or ecological ranges through a diversity of mechanisms. More specifically, we found that while obligate interactions, and especially obligate mutualisms, tend to constrain the ranges of one or both partners, facultative positive interactions tend to widen ranges. Nonetheless, there was more variation in effects of facultative interactions on range limits, pointing to important context-dependencies. Therefore, we propose that conceptual development in this field will come from studying ecological interactions in the context of networks of many species across environmental gradients, since pairwise interactions alone might overlook the indirect and environmentally-contingent effects that species have on each other in communities of many interacting species. Finally, our study also revealed key data gaps that limit our current understanding of the pervasiveness of effects that positive interactions have on species' ranges, highlighting potential avenues for future theoretical and experimental work.},

  abstract = {Males are typically the sicker sex. Data from multiple taxa indicate that they are more likely to be infected with parasites, and are less ``tolerant,'' or less able to mitigate the fitness costs of a given infection, than females. One cost of infection for many animals is an increased probability of being captured by a predator. A clear, hitherto untested, prediction is therefore that this parasite-induced vulnerability to predation is more pronounced among males than females. We tested this prediction in the sexually size dimorphic guppy, Poecilia reticulata, in which females are typically larger than males. We either sham or experimentally infected guppies with Gyrodactylus turnbulli, elicited their escape response using an established protocol and measured the distance they covered during 60 ms. To discriminate between the effects of body size and those of other inherent sex differences, we size-matched fish across treatment groups. Infection with G. turnbulli reduced the distance covered during the escape response of small adults by 20.1\%, whereas that of large fish was unaffected. This result implies that parasite-induced vulnerability to predation is male-biased in the wild: although there was no difference in escape response between our experimentally size-matched groups of males and females, males are significantly smaller across natural guppy populations. These results are consistent with Bateman's principle for immunity: Natural selection for larger body sizes and longevity in females seems to have resulted in the evolution of increased infection tolerance. We discuss the potential implications of sex- and size-biased parasite-induced vulnerability to predation for the evolutionary ecology of this host--parasite interaction in natural communities.},

With the advent of seagoing ships, long-distance trading became another important mode of spreading parasites. This review summarizes the spread of parasites using notable examples.

Here we examined phenotypic differences between dispersal-prone and philopatric individuals from repeated mark-release-recapture (MRR) experiments using an invasive agricultural pest, Ceratitis capitata. Comprehensive morphometric assessment and subsequent minimal adequate modelling using an information theoretic approach identified thorax mass : body mass ratio as a key predictor of disperser flies under semi-natural conditions. Performance differences in flight ability were then examined under controlled laboratory conditions to assess whether greater thorax mass : body mass ratio was associated with enhanced flight ability. The larger thorax : body mass ratio was associated with measurable differences in mean flight duration, most predominantly in males, and also by their willingness to disperse, scored as the number and duration of voluntary flights. No other measures of whole-animal flight performance (e.g. mean and peak vertical force, total or maximum flight duration) differed. Variation in voluntary behaviour may result in significant alterations of movement behaviour and realized dispersal in nature. This phenomenon may help explain intraspecific variation in the dispersal ability of insects.},

However, flight is energetically costly and consumes resources that could be invested in reproduction. Hippodamia convergens is an important aphid predator in North American cereal crops and other agricultural systems. Consumption of floral resources can enhance adult survival during periods of low prey availability and may improve reproductive success. We tested how an omnivorous adult diet containing floral resources (diluted honey and pulverized bee pollen) interacts with body size to influence reproduction and flight behavior compared to a prey-only diet. Two sizes of beetles were produced by controlling larval access to food---3 h daily access produced small beetles; ad libitum access produced large beetles with faster development. Reproductive performance was tracked for 18 days, and female flight activity was assayed via 3 h bouts of tethered flight. Diet composition and body size interacted to influence preoviposition period, with large females in prey-only treatments delaying oviposition the longest. The omnivorous adult diet improved 18-day fecundity relative to a prey-only diet, but egg fertility was unaffected. Adult size affected oviposition pattern, with small beetles laying smaller, but more numerous, clutches. Females flew up to 7 km in 6 h, but neither body size nor adult diet influenced flight distance, suggesting that all diet treatments generated energy reserves sufficient to power flights of short duration. However, pre-reproductive females flew {$>$} 60\% further than they did post-reproduction, likely due to the energetic costs of oviposition. Thus, access to pollen and nectar increased reproductive success and altered oviposition patterns in H. convergens, indicating the importance of floral resources in the agricultural landscape to conservation of this predator and its biological control services.},

  abstract = {Industrial-scale agriculture creates a mosaic of large monocultures in the landscape, where seasonal cropping cycles generate discontinuous resource availability for insect predators both spatially and temporally. In this environment, selection will favor predator movement and reproductive behaviors that optimize the location and effective utilization of resource (prey) pulses that are both patchy and ephemeral in nature. Using a model system to study predator movement and reproduction, we tested how discontinuous periods of food resource access that mimic fluctuating resource populations (aphids) would influence flight behavior and reproduction of a highly mobile predator, Hippodamia convergens (convergent lady beetle), and possibly modify energetic trade-offs between these behaviors. Adult beetles were provided either short (3 h) or long (6 h) food pulses daily (continuous availability) or short (6 h) or long (12 h) food pulses every other day (discontinuous availability). We measured preoviposition period, fecundity, and fertility during an 18-day oviposition period, and female tethered flight activity (3 h) before and after the oviposition period. We found that discontinuous food access delayed the onset of oviposition in the high food quantity treatment; fewer females laid eggs overall, and 18-day fecundity was lower compared with continuous provision of the same food quantity. A longer preoviposition period was associated with fewer reproductive days and lower fitness. Flight distance and fecundity were negatively correlated, suggesting that energetic expenditure in flight can deplete energetic reserves otherwise used for subsequent reproduction. The negative effects of discontinuous resource access at fine temporal scales reveal how gaps in resource availability could influence lady beetle population dynamics and their ecosystem services within the agricultural landscape.},

  abstract = {Most multicellular terrestrial organisms experience climate at scales of millimetres to metres, yet most species-climate associations are analysed at resolutions of kilometres or more. Because individuals experience heterogeneous microclimates in the landscape, species sometimes survive where the average background climate appears unsuitable, and equally may be eliminated from sites within apparently suitable grid cells where microclimatic extremes are intolerable. Local vegetation structure and topography can be important determinants of fine-resolution microclimate, but a literature search revealed that the vast majority of bioclimate studies do not include fine-scale habitat information, let alone a representation of how habitat affects microclimate. In this paper, we show that habitat type (grassland, heathland, deciduous woodland) is a major modifier of the temperature extremes experienced by organisms. We recorded differences among these habitats of more than 5{$^\circ$}C in monthly temperature maxima and minima, and of 10{$^\circ$}C in thermal range, on a par with the level of warming expected for extreme future climate change scenarios. Comparable differences were found in relation to variation in local topography (slope and aspect). Hence, we argue that the microclimatic effects of habitat and topography must be included in studies if we are to obtain sufficiently detailed projections of the ecological impacts of climate change to develop detailed adaptation strategies for the conservation of biodiversity.},

Connectivity provided by corridors increased incidence of biotically dispersed parasites (galls on Solidago odora) but not of abiotically dispersed parasites (foliar fungi on S. odora and three Lespedeza spp.). Both biotically and abiotically dispersed parasites responded to edge effects, but the direction of responses varied across species. Although our results require additional tests for generality to other species and landscapes, they suggest that, when establishing conservation corridors, managers should focus on mitigating two potential negative effects: the indirect effects of narrow corridors in creating edges and direct effects of corridors in enhancing connectivity of biotically dispersed parasites.},

Causes of recent declines likely involve multiple biotic and abiotic stressors including climate change and loss and degradation of native milkweed ({$<$}italic{$>$}Asclepias{$<$}/italic{$>$} spp.), monarchs' obligate larval host plant. Recent broad-scale modeling efforts suggest milkweed and monarch distributions in the eastern United States will expand northward during summer months while fine-scale modeling of western population overwintering sites in California indicate shifts inland and upward in elevation. However, species' response to climate measures varies at sub-regional scales across its range and both the impacts of climate change and potential adaptation measures may be sensitive to the spatial scale of climate data used, particularly in areas of complex topography. Here, we develop fine-scale models of monarch breeding habitat and milkweed distributions in Idaho, an area at the northern extent of the monarch breeding range in North America and important in western overwintering population recruitment. Our models accurately predict current distributions for showy milkweed ({$<$}italic{$>$}A. speciosa{$<$}/italic{$>$}), swamp milkweed ({$<$}italic{$>$}A. incarnata{$<$}/italic{$>$}), and monarch with AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) = 0.899, 0.981, and 0.929, respectively. Topographic, geographic, edaphic, and climatic factors all play important roles in determining milkweed and, thus, monarch distributions. In particular, our results suggest that at sub-regional and fine-scales, non-climatic factors such as soil depth, distance to water, and elevation contribute significantly. We further assess changes in potential habitat across Idaho under mid-21st century climate change scenarios and potential management implications of these changing distributions. Models project slight decreases (-1,318 km\textsuperscript{2}) in potential suitable habitat for showy milkweed and significant increases (+5,830 km\textsuperscript{2}) for swamp milkweed. Projected amounts of suitable habitat for monarch are likely to remain roughly stable with expansion nearly equal to contraction under a moderate scenario and slightly greater when under the more severe scenario. Protected areas encompass 8\% of current suitable habitat for showy milkweed, 11\% for swamp milkweed, and 9\% for monarch.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND This study aimed to estimate the impact of climate change on the ranges of crop pest species in Europe. The organisms included in the study were species from the family Tortricidae (Cydia pomonella, Lobesia botrana) and the family Pyralidae (Ostrinia nubilalis), Chrysomelidae beetles (Leptinotarsa decemlineata, Oulema melanopus) and species from the family Aphididae (Ropalosiphum padi, Sitobion avenae). Climate conditions in the year 2055 were simulated using a subset of five representative global circulation models. Model simulations using these climate change scenarios showed significant shifts in the climatic niches of the species in this study. RESULTS For Central Europe, the models predicted a shift in the ranges of pest species to higher altitudes and increases in the number of generations (NG) of the pests. In contrast, in the southern regions of Europe, the NG is likely to decrease owing to insufficient humidity. The ranges of species are likely to shift to the north. CONCLUSION Based on the ensemble-scenario mean for 2055, a climate-driven northward shift of between 3{$^\circ$} N (O. nubilalis) and 11{$^\circ$} N (L. botrana) is expected. The areas that are most sensitive to experiencing a significant increase in climate suitability for future pest persistence were identified. These areas include Central Europe, the higher altitudes of the Alps and Carpathians and areas above 55{$^\circ$} N. {\copyright} 2013 Society of Chemical Industry},

  abstract = {An individual-based model of animal dispersal and population dynamics was used to test the effects of different climate change adaptation strategies on species range shifting ability, namely the improvement of existing habitat, restoration of low quality habitat and creation of new habitat. These strategies were implemented on a landscape typical of fragmentation in the United Kingdom using spatial rules to differentiate between the allocation of strategies adjacent to or away from existing habitat patches. The total area being managed in the landscape was set at realistic levels based on recent habitat management trends. Eight species were parameterised to broadly represent different stage structure, population densities and modes of dispersal. Simulations were initialised with the species occupying 20\% of the landscape and run for 100years. As would be expected for a range of real taxa, range shifting abilities were dramatically different. This translated into large differences in their responses to the adaptation strategies. With conservative (0.5\%) estimates of the area prescribed for climate change adaptation, few species display noticeable improvements in their range shifting, demonstrating the need for greater investment in future adaptation. With a larger (1\%) prescribed area, greater range shifting improvements were found, although results were still species-specific. It was found that increasing the size of small existing habitat patches was the best way to promote range shifting, and that the creation of new stepping stone features, whilst beneficial to some species, did not have such broad effect across different species.},

  abstract = {Birds have long fascinated scientists and travellers, so their distribution and abundance through time have been better documented than those of other organisms. Many bird species are known to have gone extinct, but information on subspecies extinctions has never been synthesised comprehensively. We reviewed the timing, spatial patterns, trends and causes of avian extinctions on a global scale, identifying 279 ultrataxa (141 monotypic species and 138 subspecies of polytypic species) that have gone extinct since 1500. Species extinctions peaked in the early 20th century, then fell until the mid 20th century, and have subsequently accelerated. However, extinctions of ultrataxa peaked in the second half of the 20th century. This trend reflects a consistent decline in the rate of extinctions on islands since the beginning of the 20th century, but an acceleration in the extinction rate on continents. Most losses (78.7\% of species and 63.0\% of subspecies) occurred on oceanic islands. Geographic foci of extinctions include the Hawaiian Islands (36 taxa), mainland Australia and islands (29 taxa), the Mascarene Islands (27 taxa), New Zealand (22 taxa) and French Polynesia (19 taxa). The major proximate drivers of extinction for both species and subspecies are invasive alien species (58.2\% and 50.7\% of species and subspecies, respectively), hunting (52.4\% and 18.8\%) and agriculture, including non-timber crops and livestock farming (14.9\% and 31.9\%). In general, the distribution and drivers of subspecific extinctions are similar to those for species extinctions. However, our finding that, when subspecies are considered, the extinction rate has accelerated in recent decades is both novel and alarming.},

  abstract = {Although spider webs may be effective in trapping prey, they require energy for construction. The design of webs varies in complexity from species to species. I assume that the energetic cost of web construction is significantly different among web types or species. This cost may constrain foraging tactics, particularly web relocation, because web relocation also requires energy to make a new web. To clarify the effect of the cost of web construction on web relocation, the energy cost of web construction and the rate of web relocation were estimated for the spider Agelena limbata. This spider constructs a sheet-funnel web consisting of a tight mesh of silk threads. This web was costly in terms of the energy needed for construction, which ranged from 9 to 19 times the daily maintenance energy. The daily rate of web relocation was below 1\%, indicating high web-site tenacity. Relocation rates of species which built different types of web were compared in relation to cost of web construction. Orbweavers, which produce less costly webs than sheet-funnel weavers, relocate webs more frequently. Sheetweavers, which make webs of intermediate cost, appear to relocate webs more frequently than sheetfunnel weavers but less frequently than orbweavers. These results suggest that the energy cost of web construction is important in determining the frequency of web relocation.},

  abstract = {Global anthropogenic changes cause major impacts on species interactions, with cascading effects on ecosystem functioning. Animal-mediated pollination and seed dispersal are major mutualisms associated with distinct stages of plant reproduction. Nevertheless, we lack an integrated assessment on how multiple anthropogenic impacts affect these interrelated mutualisms. Here, we systematically reviewed the effect of the most important global anthropogenic factors (agrochemicals, climate change, fire, fragmentation, hunting, non-native species and urbanization) on pollination and seed dispersal. We evaluated which anthropogenic factors, mutualisms and their combinations have been more frequently investigated, the biogeographic and taxonomic tendencies and the most frequently recorded effects of anthropogenic factors. We show that pollination has been more broadly investigated, that the impacts of the anthropogenic factors on pollination and seed dispersal are biased towards the temperate region and forest biomes and lack representation from some relevant groups, such as mutualistic bats. Moreover, some anthropogenic factors have been more studied for one mutualism type in relation to the other, for instance, agrochemicals and urbanization on plant-pollinator interactions, even though these impacts could also generate direct and cascading effects on frugivores and seed dispersal. The predominance of negative effects observed, especially of climate change on plant-pollinator and non-native species on plant-frugivore interactions deserve special attention. Finally, we identify a gap in empirical studies that simultaneously consider pollination and seed dispersal as integrated components of plant reproduction, and combined anthropogenic factors in the same ecosystem. More integrative studies are needed to better understand the vulnerability of plant-animal mutualisms in a changing world.},

  abstract = {Investigation of gas exchange patterns and modulation of metabolism provide insight into metabolic control systems and evolution in diverse terrestrial environments. Variation in metabolic rate in response to environmental conditions has been explained largely in the context of two contrasting hypotheses, namely metabolic depression in response to stressful or resource-(e.g. water) limited conditions, or elevation of metabolism at low temperatures to sustain life in extreme conditions. To deconstruct the basis for metabolic rate changes in response to temperature variation, here we undertake a full factorial study investigating the longer- and short-term effects of temperature exposure on gas exchange patterns. We examined responses of traits of gas exchange [standard metabolic rate (SMR); discontinuous gas exchange (DGE) cycle frequency; cuticular, respiratory and total water loss rate (WLR)] to elucidate the magnitude and form of plastic responses in the dung beetle, Scarabaeus spretus. Results showed that short- and longer-term temperature variation generally have significant effects on SMR and WLR. Overall, acclimation to increased temperature led to a decline in SMR (from 0.071{\textpm}0.004 ml CO2 h--1 in 15{$^\circ$}C-acclimated beetles to 0.039{\textpm}0.004 ml CO2 h--1 in 25{$^\circ$}C-acclimated beetles measured at 20{$^\circ$}C) modulated by reduced DGE frequency (15{$^\circ$}C acclimation: 0.554{\textpm}0.027 mHz, 20{$^\circ$}C acclimation: 0.257{\textpm}0.030 mHz, 25{$^\circ$}C acclimation: 0.208{\textpm}0.027 mHz recorded at 20{$^\circ$}C), reduced cuticular WLRs (from 1.058{\textpm}0.537 mg h--1 in 15{$^\circ$}C-acclimated beetles to 0.900{\textpm}0.400 mg h--1 in 25{$^\circ$}C-acclimated beetles measured at 20{$^\circ$}C) and reduced total WLR (from 4.2{\textpm}0.5 mg h--1 in 15{$^\circ$}C-acclimated beetles to 3.1{\textpm}0.5 mg h--1 in 25{$^\circ$}C-acclimated beetles measured at 25{$^\circ$}C). Respiratory WLR was reduced from 2.25{\textpm}0.40 mg h--1 in 15{$^\circ$}C-acclimated beetles to 1.60{\textpm}0.40 mg h--1 in 25{$^\circ$}C-acclimated beetles measured at 25{$^\circ$}C, suggesting conservation of water during DGE bursts. Overall, this suggests water conservation is a priority for S. spretus exposed to longer-term temperature variation, rather than elevation of SMR in response to low temperature acclimation, as might be expected from a beetle living in a relatively warm, low rainfall summer region. These results are significant for understanding the evolution of gas exchange patterns and trade-offs between metabolic rate and water balance in insects and other terrestrial arthropods.},

Bat fly and mite densities were compared among wild-caught bats in Belize with different roosting preferences (cavity, foliage, or both), and grooming behaviour was analysed for bat species with high and low ectoparasite density. Ectoparasites of bats were removed using forceps, and bat grooming behaviour was recorded with a camcorder. Because bat flies pupate on the surface of host roosts, bats that use cavity roosts (a sheltered environment for the pupae) were predicted to have higher densities of bat flies than those that use foliage (exposed environment). Cavity-roosting species generally had higher densities of bat flies and mites, although the relationship was more evident for bat flies. The grooming behaviour of bats was predicted to differ among species with high or low ectoparasite densities. Although there was no difference in the frequency of grooming behaviours for individuals with and without bat flies, there were differences in grooming behaviour at the species level. Bat species with high ectoparasite densities scratched more than those with low ectoparasite densities. These results suggest that ectoparasite densities and grooming behaviour are related to roosting preferences in bats.},

This then suggests that dispersal play a central role in the response of populations and species to ever-increasing global change, including climate change, habitat loss and fragmentation, and biological invasions. During a symposium held at Lund University (Sweden), the causes and consequences of dispersal were discussed, and here we provide an overview of the talks. As the discussions often gravitated towards the role and our understanding of dispersal in a changing world and given the urgent challenges posed by it, we place this overview in the context of global change. We draw and discuss four conclusions: (i) methodological advances provide opportunities for improved future studies, (ii) dispersal distances can be much greater than previously thought (examples in plants and vertebrates), but also much more restricted (examples in micro-organisms), (iii) dispersal is more dynamic than we often care to admit (e.g. due to individual variation, effects of parasites, variation in life history, developmental and evolutionary responses, community impacts), (iv) using results of dispersal research for detailed prediction of outcomes under global change is currently mostly out of reach -- nevertheless, that should not stop us from showing the many negative consequences of global change, and how dispersal is often a limiting factor in adapting to this.},

Despite this, the cool margins of many species' distributions have expanded rapidly in association with recent climate warming3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. We examined four insect species that have expanded their geographical ranges in Britain over the past 20 years. Here we report that two butterfly species have increased the variety of habitat types that they can colonize, and that two bush cricket species show increased fractions of longer-winged (dispersive) individuals in recently founded populations. Both ecological and evolutionary processes are probably responsible for these changes. Increased habitat breadth and dispersal tendencies have resulted in about 3- to 15-fold increases in expansion rates, allowing these insects to cross habitat disjunctions that would have represented major or complete barriers to dispersal before the expansions started. The emergence of dispersive phenotypes will increase the speed at which species invade new environments, and probably underlies the responses of many species to both past11 and future climate change.},

These data are temporally and spatially dispersed and could have limitations regarding biases in the distribution of the observations in space and/or time.

We use data collected through a Portuguese citizen science database (biodiversity4all.org). We use a zero-inflated negative binomial regression to model the distribution of observations as a function of a set of variables representing the landscape features plausibly influencing the spatial distribution of the records. Results suggest that the density of paths is the most important variable, having a statistically significant positive relationship with number of observations for seven of the eight taxa considered. Wetland coverage was also identified as having a significant, positive relationship, for birds, amphibians and reptiles, and mammals. Our results highlight that the distribution of species observations, in citizen science projects, is spatially biased. Higher frequency of observations is driven largely by accessibility and by the presence of water bodies. We conclude that efforts are required to increase the spatial evenness of sampling effort from volunteers.},

Location The study was conducted in a 4900-km2 study region extending from Long Island Sound northward to the southern border of Massachusetts and including the Connecticut River Valley in Connecticut, USA. Methods Bird surveys were conducted at 40 points in 12 hemlock stands varying in HWA infestation and overstory mortality levels during the avian breeding seasons of 2000 and 2001. Ten-minute, 50-m radius point counts were used to survey all birds seen or heard at each point. Overstory and understory vegetation were sampled at each point. Indicator species analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling were used to examine relationships between avian community composition and vegetation structure. Results Overstory hemlock mortality was highly correlated with avian community composition. Abundance of eastern wood-pewee (Contopus virens), brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater), tufted titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor), white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis), red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus), hooded warbler (Wilsonia citrina), and several woodpecker species was highest at points with {$>$}60\% mortality. Black-throated green warbler (Dendroica virens), Acadian flycatcher (Empidonax virescens), blackburnian warbler (Dendroica fusca), and hermit thrush (Catharus guttatus) were strongly associated with intact hemlock stands that exhibit little or no mortality from HWA. Conclusions Eastern hemlock has unique structural characteristics that provide important habitat for numerous bird species in the north-eastern US. As a result, removal of hemlock by HWA has profound effects on avian communities. Black-throated green warbler, blackburnian warbler, and Acadian flycatcher are very strongly associated with hemlock forests in southern New England and appear to be particularly sensitive to hemlock removal. The hooded warbler, a species whose status is of regional concern, may actually benefit from the development of a dense hardwood seedling layer associated with high hemlock mortality.},

  abstract = {Ecology Letters (2010) 13: 1459--1474 Abstract There is growing concern that rapid environmental degradation threatens mutualistic interactions. Because mutualisms can bind species to a common fate, mutualism breakdown has the potential to expand and accelerate effects of global change on biodiversity loss and ecosystem disruption. The current focus on the ecological dynamics of mutualism under global change has skirted fundamental evolutionary issues. Here, we develop an evolutionary perspective on mutualism breakdown to complement the ecological perspective, by focusing on three processes: (1) shifts from mutualism to antagonism, (2) switches to novel partners and (3) mutualism abandonment. We then identify the evolutionary factors that may make particular classes of mutualisms especially susceptible or resistant to breakdown and discuss how communities harbouring mutualisms may be affected by these evolutionary responses. We propose a template for evolutionary research on mutualism resilience and identify conservation approaches that may help conserve targeted mutualisms in the face of environmental change.},

  abstract = {Beneficial microorganisms shape the evolutionary trajectories of their hosts, facilitating or constraining the colonization of new ecological niches. One convincing example entails the responses of insect--microbe associations to rising temperatures. Indeed, insect resilience to stressful high temperatures depends on the genetic identity of the obligate symbiont and the presence of heat-protective facultative symbionts. As extensively studied organisms, aphids and their endosymbiotic bacteria represent valuable models to address eco-evolutionary questions about the thermal ecology of insect--microbe partnerships, with broad relevance to various biological systems and insect models. This meta-analysis aims to quantify the context-dependent impacts of symbionts on host phenotype in benign or stressful heat conditions, across fitness traits, types of heat stress and symbiont species. We found that warming lowered the benefits (resistance to parasitoids) and costs (development, fecundity) of infection by facultative symbionts, which was overall mostly beneficial to the hosts under short-term heat stress (heat shock) rather than extended warming. Heat-tolerant genotypes of the obligate symbiont               Buchnera aphidicola               and some facultative symbionts (               Rickettsia               sp.,               Serratia symbiotica               ) improved or maintained aphid fitness under heat stress. We discuss the implications of these findings for the general understanding of the cost--benefit balance of insect--microbe associations across multiple traits and their eco-evolutionary dynamics faced with climate change.},

Invasions disrupt native mutualisms, often leading to population declines, reduced biodiversity, and altered ecosystem functioning. Focusing on three main types of mutualisms (pollination, seed dispersal, and plant-microbial symbioses) and drawing on examples from different ecosystems and from species- and community-level studies, we review the key mechanisms whereby such positive interactions mediate invasions and are in turn influenced by invasions. High interaction generalization is ``the norm'' in most systems, allowing alien species to infiltrate recipient communities. We identify traits that influence invasiveness (e.g., selfing capacity in plants, animal behavioral traits) or invasibility (e.g., partner choice in mycorrhizas/rhizobia) through mutualistic interactions. Mutualistic disruptions due to invasions are pervasive, and subsequent cascading effects are also widespread. Ecological networks provide a useful framework for predicting tipping points for community collapse in response to invasions and other synergistic drivers of global change.},

Lattice models have been used to investigate how hypothetical species with different characteristics respond to habitat loss. The main result shows that a sharp threshold in habitat availability exists below which a species rapidly becomes extinct. Here, a similar modelling approach is taken to establish what determines how species respond to climate change. A similar threshold exists for the rate of climate change as has been observed for habitat loss-patch occupancy remains high up to a critical rate of climate change, beyond which species extinction becomes likely. Habitat specialists, especially those of relatively poor colonizing ability are least able to keep pace with climate change. The interaction between climate change and habitat loss might be disastrous. During climate change, the habitat threshold occurs sooner. Similarly, species suffer more from climate change in a fragmented habitat.},

  abstract = {Dispersal is fundamental in determining biodiversity responses to rapid climate change, but recently acquired ecological and evolutionary knowledge is seldom accounted for in either predictive methods or conservation planning. We emphasise the accumulating evidence for direct and indirect impacts of climate change on dispersal. Additionally, evolutionary theory predicts increases in dispersal at expanding range margins, and this has been observed in a number of species. This multitude of ecological and evolutionary processes is likely to lead to complex responses of dispersal to climate change. As a result, improvement of models of species' range changes will require greater realism in the representation of dispersal. Placing dispersal at the heart of our thinking will facilitate development of conservation strategies that are resilient to climate change, including landscape management and assisted colonisation. Synthesis This article seeks synthesis across the fields of dispersal ecology and evolution, species distribution modelling and conservation biology. Increasing effort focuses on understanding how dispersal influences species' responses to climate change. Importantly, though perhaps not broadly widely-recognised, species' dispersal characteristics are themselves likely to alter during rapid climate change. We compile evidence for direct and indirect influences that climate change may have on dispersal, some ecological and others evolutionary. We emphasise the need for predictive modelling to account for this dispersal realism and highlight the need for conservation to make better use of our existing knowledge related to dispersal.},

  abstract = {There has been considerable recent interest in understanding the role of positive inter-specific interactions within ecology, and significant progress has been made both empirically and theoretically. Similarly, considerable progress has been made in improving our understanding of the mechanisms that limit species' ranges. In this contribution, we seek to understand the setting of species' borders when some species within the assemblage exhibit positive inter-specific interactions. We use a spatially explicit dual-lattice simulation model to explore the distribution of different interactions across environmental gradients. We first simulate community dynamics when there is either a gradient in reproductive rate or in mortality. We then consider what happens when gradients in reproduction and mortality run in parallel or perpendicular to one another. If the stress gradient impacts on reproductive potential, positive interactions are found where there is high abiotic stress. In this instance, the mutualists are able to tolerate an environment that the cheaters cannot. However, when the stress gradient influences mortality, we find that the mutualists occur as a stripe surrounded by cheaters both towards the better and the harsher ends of the gradient. Previous theory and most empirical evidence tend to indicate that net positive interactions are likely to occur in environments characterized by high abiotic stress. However, evidence from some stress gradients suggests that the distribution of positive and negative interactions can be more complex, with the most stressful environments being occupied by individuals engaging in negative rather than positive interactions. Our results provide a potential theoretical explanation for these recent field observation, and highlight the need for further theoretical and empirical work to better our understanding of how positive and negative interactions act to determine the limits to species' ranges.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Roads are a widespread and increasing feature of most landscapes. We reviewed the scientific literature on the ecological effects of roads and found support for the general conclusion that they are associated with negative effects on biotic integrity in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Roads of all kinds have seven general effects: mortality from road construction, mortality from collision with vehicles, modification of animal behavior, alteration of the physical environment, alteration of the chemical environment, spread of exotics, and increased use of areas by humans. Road construction kills sessile and slow-moving organisms, injures organisms adjacent to a road, and alters physical conditions beneath a road. Vehicle collisions affect the demography of many species, both vertebrates and invertebrates; mitigation measures to reduce roadkill have been only partly successful. Roads alter animal behavior by causing changes in home ranges, movement, reproductive success, escape response, and physiological state. Roads change soil density, temperature, soil water content, light levels, dust, surface waters, patterns of runoff, and sedimentation, as well as adding heavy metals (especially lead), salts, organic molecules, ozone, and nutrients to roadside environments. Roads promote the dispersal of exotic species by altering habitats, stressing native species, and providing movement corridors. Roads also promote increased hunting, fishing, passive harassment of animals, and landscape modifications. Not all species and ecosystems are equally affected by roads, but overall the presence of roads is highly correlated with changes in species composition, population sizes, and hydrologic and geomorphic processes that shape aquatic and riparian systems. More experimental research is needed to complement post-hoc correlative studies. Our review underscores the importance to conservation of avoiding construction of new roads in roadless or sparsely roaded areas and of removal or restoration of existing roads to benefit both terrestrial and aquatic biota.},

In contrast, S. nr fragariae showed consistent evidence for adaptation to cooler conditions, and S. miscanthi2n=17 was approximately intermediate.

Prey arriving from predator-free patches might also have evolved weaker defenses against predators and thus enhance trophic subsidies by providing easily captured prey. Using local models assuming a linear or accelerating trade-off between defense and population growth rate, we demonstrate that immigration of undefended prey increased predator abundances and decreased defended prey through eco-evolutionary apparent competition. In individual-based models with spatial structure, explicit genetics, and gene flow along an environmental gradient, prey became maladapted to predators at the predator's range edge, and greater gene flow enhanced this maladaptation. The predator gained a subsidy from these easily captured prey, which enhanced its abundance, facilitated its persistence in marginal habitats, extended its range extent, and enhanced range shifts during environmental changes, such as climate change. Once the predator expanded, prey adapted to it and the advantage disappeared, resulting in an elastic predator range margin driven by eco-evolutionary dynamics. Overall, the results indicate a need to consider gene flow--induced maladaptation and species interactions as mutual forces that frequently determine ecological and evolutionary dynamics and patterns in nature.},

Most predictions assume simplistic dispersal scenarios and ignore biotic interactions. We argue for incorporating the complexities of dispersal and species interactions. Range expansions depend not just on mean dispersal, but also on the shape of the dispersal kernel and the population's growth rate. We show how models using species-specific dispersal can produce more accurate predictions than models applying all-or-nothing dispersal scenarios. Models that additionally include species interactions can generate distinct outcomes. For example, species interactions can slow climate tracking and produce more extinctions than models assuming no interactions. We conclude that (1) just knowing mean dispersal is insufficient to predict biotic responses to climate change, and (2) considering interspecific dispersal variation and species interactions jointly will be necessary to anticipate future changes to biological diversity. We advocate for collecting key information on interspecific dispersal differences and strong biotic interactions so that we can build the more robust predictive models that will be necessary to inform conservation efforts as climates continue to change.},

  abstract = {In ecology understanding variation in connectivity is central for how biodiversity is maintained. Field studies on dispersal and temporal dynamics in community regulating processes are, however, rare. We test the short-term temporal stability in community composition in a soft-sediment benthic community by determining among-sampling interval similarity in community composition. We relate stability to in situ measures of connectivity (wind, wave, current energy) and rates of dispersal (quantified in different trap types). Waves were an important predictor of when local community taxa are most likely to disperse in different trap-types, suggesting that wave energy is important for connectivity in a region. Community composition at the site was variable and changed stochastically over time. We found changes in community composition (occurrence, abundance, dominance) to be greater at times when connectivity and rates of dispersal were low. In response to periods of lower connectedness dominant taxa in the local community only exhibited change in their relative abundance. In contrast, locally less abundant taxa varied in both their presence, as well as in relative abundance. Constancy in connectivity and rates of dispersal promotes community stability and persistence, suggesting that local community composition will be impacted by changes in the spatial extent over which immigration and emigration operates in the region. Few empirical studies have actually measured dispersal directly in a multi-species context to demonstrate the role it plays in maintaining local community structure. Even though our study does not evaluate coexistence over demographic time scales, it importantly demonstrates that dispersal is not only important in initial recruitment or following a disturbance, but also key in maintaining local community composition.},

Recent work has primarily focused on host health (i.e. immunocompetence) whereas ecological factors have been largely neglected. Here we investigate whether the immunocompetence, the nutritional condition or body size of nestling European bee-eaters Merops apiaster are used as parameters for habitat choice of the haematophagous fly Carnus hemapterus. We found that (i) flies consistently and non-randomly preferred larger nestlings, even after controlling for differences in habitat availability (host surface), (ii) in the presence of similar-sized hosts, parasites' choice for an individual was less likely than if hosts differed in size, (iii) the more the hosts differed in size, the more the parasites aggregated on the larger nestling and (iv) parasites changed their preference according to size criteria regardless of the identity of the larger host. Neither immunocompetence nor host body condition could account for parasites' preference. Our results do not support the prediction of the Tasty Chick Hypothesis, namely that the poor immunocompetence ability of junior chicks makes them more attractive to parasites. We conclude that basic ecological factors (e.g. body size) can be essential for parasites when choosing a host.},

  abstract = {Climatic models predict a 1.7--4.9{$^\circ$}C increase in mean global temperatures from 1990 to 2100. In ecosystems in general, multitrophic interactions often result from a long co-evolutionary process specific to a particular environment and relatively stable climatic conditions. Temperature changes may differentially affect the biology of each of the component species of a system: for example, the herbivores, their natural enemies (parasitoids, predators and pathogens), and hyperparasitoids. The endosymbionts of these different insects are also affected, and their functions can be altered by temperature increase. Such effects could destabilise system dynamics even lead to extinctions. The effects of climatic change are likely to be relatively more important in higher trophic levels that depend on the capacity of lower trophic levels to adapt to these changes. This paper addresses the effects of climate on insect communities, focusing on aphids, aphids parasitoids and predators, and hyperparasitoids. For each trophic level, the general effect of temperature change on insects is discussed, with emphasis on species belonging to aphid-based communities. The effects of climate change on communities can be short-term or long-term. Short-term consequences include the direct effects of temperature on different life history traits such as development time (which affects the annual number of generations), metabolic rate (which affects activity levels, longevity, and fecundity), and sex allocation. Potential effects on endosymbiont survival, virus transmission, geographical distribution of species and phenological synchronisation between trophic levels are also discussed. Long-term effects involve genetic changes in populations associated with climatic adaptations.

This paper deals with a systematic way to acquire knowledge about the probabilities of successful road crossing by mammals and what characteristics affect this traversability. We derive a model from traffic flow theory to estimate traffic mortality in mammals related to relevant road, traffic and species characteristics. The probability of successful road crossing is determined by the pavement width of the road, traffic volume, traversing speed of the mammals and their body length. We include the traversability model in a simple two-patch population model to explore the effects of these road, traffic and species characteristics on population dynamics. Analysis of the models show that, for our parameter ranges, traffic volume and traversing speed have the largest effect on traffic mortality. The population size is especially negatively affected when roads have to be crossed during the daily movements. These predictions could be useful to determine the expected effectiveness of mitigating measures relative to the current situation. Mitigating measures might alter the road and traffic characteristics. The effects of these changes on traffic mortality and population dynamics could be analysed by calculating the number of traffic victims before and after the mitigating measures.},

  abstract = {Including threats in spatial conservation prioritization helps identify areas for conservation actions where biodiversity is at imminent risk of extinction. At the global level, an important limitation when identifying spatial priorities for conservation actions is the lack of information on the spatial distribution of threats. Here, we identify spatial conservation priorities under three prominent threats to biodiversity (residential and commercial development, agricultural expansion, and forest loss), which are primary drivers of habitat loss and threaten the persistence of the highest number of species in the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, and for which spatial data is available. We first explore how global priority areas for the conservation of vertebrate (mammals, birds, and amphibians) species coded in the Red List as vulnerable to each threat differ spatially. We then identify spatial conservation priorities for all species vulnerable to all threats. Finally, we identify the potentially most threatened areas by overlapping the identified priority areas for conservation with maps for each threat. We repeat the same with four other well-known global conservation priority area schemes, namely Key Biodiversity Areas, Biodiversity Hotspots, the global Protected Area Network, and Wilderness Areas. We find that residential and commercial development directly threatens only about 4\% of the global top 17\% priority areas for species vulnerable under this threat. However, 50\% of the high priority areas for species vulnerable to forest loss overlap with areas that have already experienced some forest loss. Agricultural expansion overlapped with {\textasciitilde}20\% of high priority areas. Biodiversity Hotspots had the greatest proportion of their total area under direct threat from all threats, while expansion of low intensity agriculture was found to pose an imminent threat to Wilderness Areas under future agricultural expansion. Our results identify areas where limited resources should be allocated to mitigate risks to vertebrate species from habitat loss.},

We focused on network motifs, subnetworks composed of a small number of species exhibiting particular patterns of interaction, to examine the structure and diversity of mutualistic networks. We found that the hummingbird--mistletoe--marsupial mutualism plays a critical role in the community by increasing the complexity of pollination and seed dispersal networks through supporting a high diversity of interactions. Moreover, we found that the disruption of this tripartite mutualism by non-native ungulates resulted in diverse indirect effects that led to less complex pollination and seed dispersal networks.

Intense human pressure, both direct and indirect, is having profound effects on natural environments. The amphibians---frogs, salamanders, and caecilians---may be the only major group currently at risk globally. A detailed worldwide assessment and subsequent updates show that one-third or more of the 6,300 species are threatened with extinction. This trend is likely to accelerate because most amphibians occur in the tropics and have small geographic ranges that make them susceptible to extinction. The increasing pressure from habitat destruction and climate change is likely to have major impacts on narrowly adapted and distributed species. We show that salamanders on tropical mountains are particularly at risk. A new and significant threat to amphibians is a virulent, emerging infectious disease, chytridiomycosis, which appears to be globally distributed, and its effects may be exacerbated by global warming. This disease, which is caused by a fungal pathogen and implicated in serious declines and extinctions of {$>$}200 species of amphibians, poses the greatest threat to biodiversity of any known disease. Our data for frogs in the Sierra Nevada of California show that the fungus is having a devastating impact on native species, already weakened by the effects of pollution and introduced predators. A general message from amphibians is that we may have little time to stave off a potential mass extinction.},

  abstract = {Temperature dependency of consumer--resource interactions is fundamentally important for understanding and predicting the responses of food webs to climate change. Previous studies have shown temperature-driven shifts in herbivore consumption rates and resource preference, but these effects remain poorly understood for predatory arthropods. Here, we investigate how predator killing rates, prey mass consumption, and macronutrient intake respond to increased temperatures using a laboratory and a field reciprocal transplant experiment. Ectothermic predators, wolf spiders (Pardosa sp.), in the lab experiment, were exposed to increased temperatures and different prey macronutrient content (high lipid/low protein and low lipid/high protein) to assess changes in their killing rates and nutritional demands. Additionally, we investigate prey mass and lipid consumption by spiders under contrasting temperatures, along an elevation gradient. We used a field reciprocal transplant experiment between low (420 masl; 26{$^\circ$}C) and high (2,100 masl; 15{$^\circ$}C) elevations in the Ecuadorian Andes, using wild populations of two common orb-weaver spider species (Leucauge sp. and Cyclosa sp.) present along the elevation gradient. We found that killing rates of wolf spiders increased with warmer temperatures but were not significantly affected by prey macronutrient content, although spiders consumed significantly more lipids from lipid-rich prey. The field reciprocal transplant experiment showed no consistent predator responses to changes in temperature along the elevational gradient. Transplanting Cyclosa sp. spiders to low- or high-elevation sites did not affect their prey mass or lipid consumption rate, whereas Leucauge sp. individuals increased prey mass consumption when transplanted from the high to the low warm elevation. Our findings show that increases in temperature intensify predator killing rates, prey consumption, and lipid intake, but the responses to temperature vary between species, which may be a result of species-specific differences in their hunting behavior and sensitivity to temperature.},

Dispersal was recorded more often when the wind changed to a more southerly direction from the more common westerly winds, and when minimum temperatures were lower. The effect of wind direction was greatest in the winter and minimum temperature was most important in the autumn. Poor weather did not appear to initiate dispersal. 3. Dispersal distance was most strongly correlated with maximum temperature during dispersal and wind direction in the following 5-day period. Combined with the sex of the buzzard these three variables accounted for 60\% of the variation in dispersal distance. 4.

Dispersal is regarded as critical to the stability of existing populations and the spread of invading species, but empirical data on the effect of travelling conditions during the transfer phase are rare. We present evidence that both timing and distance of ex-natal dispersal in buzzards (Buteo buteo) are strongly affected by weather. 2. Dispersal was recorded more often when the wind changed to a more southerly direction from the more common westerly winds, and when minimum temperatures were lower. The effect of wind direction was greatest in the winter and minimum temperature was most important in the autumn. Poor weather did not appear to initiate dispersal. 3. Dispersal distance was most strongly correlated with maximum temperature during dispersal and wind direction in the following 5-day period. Combined with the sex of the buzzard these three variables accounted for 60\% of the variation in dispersal distance. 4. These results are important for conservationists who manage species recovery programs and wildlife managers who model biological invasions.},

Using a novel approach we obtained accurate field measurements of daily movements for individuals over time to parameterize our model. Males were found to move significantly further on average than females. Significant variation in movement was evident among individuals; the most dispersive individuals moved up to five (females) and seven (males) times as far on average as the least dispersive individuals. Mean relative daily movement of both males and females were exponentially related to maximum daily temperature recorded within the grass sward. Variability, both within and among individuals, in relative daily movement was incorporated into the model using gamma probability distributions. Resultant dispersal functions for seasonal movement are predicted to be highly leptokurtic, which agrees well with observations from the field. Predictions of the model suggest that for populations at the polewards edge of the current range an increase of 3--5{$\mkern1mu^\circ$}C in daily maximum temperature may increase the proportion of long-distance dispersers (those characterized as comprising the top 0.1\% of furthest dispersing individuals under local conditions experienced during the 1963--1990 period) by up to 70\%.},

  abstract = {Alternative tactics used by males to obtain mates usually are associated with genetic and/or phenotypic differences between the behavioral morphs. This system of white-faced dragonfly (Leucorrhinia intacta) alternatives is characterized by plasticity of tactical options for individual males. Males may act either as territorials, and defend small perch-centered territories on the study pond, or they act as transients, spending most of their time in vegetation surrounding the pond and sallying out at intervals in search of mates. The two tactics remain in constant proportions over a broad range of densities, so transients do not result only from a `filling in' of suitable territorial sites. Males adopt tactics independently from day to day, with no significant influences of phenotypic variation, priority of arrival at the breeding site, or prior success in a role. We interpret this system as based on conditional, frequency-dependent choice of alternatives by a population of males not differing significantly in their abilities to employ one tactic or the other, but we cannot exclude entirely the possibility of mixed strategies. Average daily mating success is equal for territorial and transient males, supporting predictions of mixed and conditional ESS hypotheses. Males of each tactic obtain matings daily in proportion to their representation in the population for most data samples. Deviations from the expected mating success provide no information of use in selecting one or the other tactic on subsequent days. We suggest this system of alternatives represents a conditional mating strategy, in which males adopt tactics based on the availability of perches relative to oviposition substrate and on interactions within and between tactics that are influenced by the relative frequencies of territorial and transient males.},

  abstract = {Successful species interactions require that both partners share a similar cue. For many species, spring warming acts as a shared signal to synchronize mutualist behaviors. Spring flowering plants and the ants that disperse their seeds respond to warming temperatures so that ants forage when plants drop seeds. However, where warm-adapted ants replace cold-adapted ants, changes in this timing might leave early seeds stranded without a disperser. We investigate plant seed dispersal south and north of a distinct boundary between warm- and cold-adapted ants to determine if changes in the ant species influence local plant dispersal. The warm-adapted ants forage much later than the cold-adapted ants, and so we first assess natural populations of early and late blooming plants. We then transplant these plants south and north of the ant boundary to test whether distinct ant climate requirements disrupt the ant--plant mutualism. Whereas the early blooming plant's inability to synchronize with the warm-adapted ant leaves its populations clumped and patchy and its seedlings clustered around the parents in natural populations, when transplanted into the range of the cold-adapted ant, effective seed dispersal recovers. In contrast, the mutualism persists for the later blooming plant regardless of location because it sets seed later in spring when both warm- and cold-adapted ant species forage, resulting in effective seed dispersal. These results indicate that the climate response of species interactions, not just the species themselves, is integral in understanding ecological responses to a changing climate. Data linking phenological synchrony and dispersal are rare, and these results suggest a viable mechanism by which a species' range is limited more by biotic than abiotic interactions -- despite the general assumption that biotic influences are buried within larger climate drivers. These results show that biotic partner can be as fundamental a niche requirement as abiotic resources.},

In such a situation the "best" dispersal distance would be zero, but the constraint of competition would prevent many individuals from achieving this ideal; the actual dispersal distances would be shaped by population demography. The models I describe predict the distribution of dispersal distances as a function of home range turnover probability for animals that move to the first uncontested home range they encounter and no farther. The models provide a good match to data for some, but not all, avian and mammalian data sets, suggesting (1) that competition for resources limiting to reproduction may be the primary factor driving dispersal, and (2) that the action of inbreeding avoidance, habitat selection, and other processes suggested to influence dispersal distances can be detected as deviations from these model predictions.},

Body size often influences parasite load in reptiles, but it is unclear whether higher levels of parasitism are a result of greater surface area of individuals (a function of size) or of longer periods of exposure to parasites (a function of age). Using skeletochronology in a wild population of Clark's Spiny Lizards (Sceloporus clarkii Baird and Girard, 1852), we tested the hypotheses that (i) larger individuals have higher parasite loads due to increased surface area available for colonization by parasites and their vectors and that (ii) older individuals have higher parasite loads because they have had longer exposure to parasites and their vectors. Males harboured more ectoparasites than females. Males and females differed in how body size influenced chigger (Acari: Trombiculidae) load; larger males harboured more chiggers than smaller males, but this was not the case in females. Age did not affect ectoparasite load in either sex. These results emphasize the importance of disentangling the effects of size and age in models of parasitism to gain a clearer understanding of intraspecific variation in parasite load.},

However, coevolution is difficult to demonstrate rigorously in practice and therefore has rarely been observed empirically, particularly in animal-parasite systems. Research on host-schistosome interactions has the potential for making an important contribution to the study of coevolution or reciprocal adaptation. This may be particularly pertinent because schistosomes represent an indirectly transmitted macroparasite, so often overlooked among both theoretical and empirical studies. Here we present ideas and experiments on host-schistosome interactions, in part reviewed from published work but focusing in particular on preliminary novel data from our ongoing studies of potential host-schistosome evolution and coevolution in the laboratory. The article is split into three main sections: we first focus on the evidence for evolution in the host, then in the parasite, before combining both to illustrate the gathering evidence of host-parasite coevolution in the snail-schistosome system. In particular, we demonstrate that genetic architecture, variability, and selective pressures are present for the evolution of resistance and susceptibility, virulence, and infectivity to occur, the mechanisms allowing such polymorphisms to be maintained, and that hosts and parasites appear to have reciprocal effects on each other's phenotype and genotype.},

The diel movement patterns of French grunt, a common Caribbean coral reef fish, are well documented and known to connect reef and seagrass habitat. In the northeastern Caribbean, French grunts are known to be infected by Anilocra haemuli, one of the largest and most conspicuous ectoparasitic isopods. Studies on Anilocra infection have demonstrated that infection reduces host swimming performance and condition and may alter host behavior. We tested predictions of the hypothesis that A. haemuli infection influences the movement patterns of host French grunt, specifically whether short-distance daytime movements and/or reef--seagrass migration~at dusk was associated with infection. We conducted focal observations on infected and uninfected fish during both daytime resting and dusk migration periods. We also conducted daytime and nocturnal surveys~in reef habitat, documenting changes in the proportion of infected individuals. We found that infected fish move significantly less than uninfected conspecifics during the day and observed 100~\% of uninfected focal fish and 37.5~\% of infected focal fish departing the reef during dusk. In reef habitat,~the proportion of fish infected with Anilocra~was also significantly greater at night compared to daytime. We suggest that A. haemuli infection alters host movement patterns and that parasitism may therefore indirectly influence trophic connectivity between reef and seagrass ecosystems.},

Bacterial symbionts of insects offer valuable models to examine how microbes can facilitate and constrain adaptation to a changing environment. While some symbionts confer plasticity that accelerates adaptation, long-term bacterial mutualists of insects are characterized by tight lifestyle constraints, genome deterioration, and vulnerability to thermal stress. These essential bacterial partners are eliminated at high temperatures, analogous to the loss of zooanthellae during coral bleaching. Recent field-based studies suggest that thermal sensitivity of bacterial mutualists constrains insect responses. In this sense, highly dependent mutualisms may be the Achilles' heel of thermal responses in insects.},

Identical populations of three size-classes of bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) were stocked on both sides of a divided pond (29 m in diameter), and eight piscivorous largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) were introduced to one side. Sizes of both species were chosen such that the small class of bluegills was very vulnerable to the bass, whereas the largest class was invulnerable to bass predation. We then compared mortality, habitat use, and growth of each size-class in the presence and absence of the bass. Only the small size-class suffered significant mortality from the bass (each bass consumed on average about one small bluegill every 3.8 d); the two larger size-classes exhibited similar mortality rates on both sides of the pond. In the absence of the bass, we found that habitat use of all size-classes was similar and that the pattern of habitat use maximized foraging return rates (Werner et al. 1983). In the presence of the bass the two larger size-classes chose habitats to maximize return rates, but the small size-class obtained a greater fraction of its diet from the vegetation habitat, where foraging return rates were only one-third of those in the more open habitats. The small size-class further exhibited a significant depression in individual growth in the presence of the bass; the growth increment during the experiment was 27\% less than that for small bluegills in the absence of the bass. Because of the reduced utilization of more open habitats by the small fish in the presence of bass, resources in these habitats were released to the larger size-classes, which showed greater growth in the presence of the bass than in its absence. We develop methods to predict the additional mortality expected on a cohort due to a reduction in growth rate (because individuals are spending a longer time in vunerable sizes), and discuss and potential for predation risk to enforce size-class segregation, which leads de facto to resource partitioning.},

The honeydew and haemolymph of the aphids were iso-osmotic, and their osmotic pressure was significantly lower in untreated aphids (0.91--0.95 MPa) than in antibiotic-treated aphids (1.01--1.05 MPa) (P\&lt;0.05). For insects reared on chemically defined diets containing 0.15--1.0 mol l-1 sucrose (osmotic pressure 1.1--4.0 MPa), the osmotic pressure of the aphid haemolymph did not vary with dietary osmotic pressure, but was regulated to approximately 1.0 MPa in untreated and 1.3 MPa in antibiotic-treated aphids. The sugars in the aphid honeydew varied with dietary sucrose concentration; with monosaccharides dominant at low concentrations and oligosaccharides dominant at high concentrations of dietary sucrose. The lowest dietary sucrose concentration at which honeydew oligosaccharides were detected was 0.2 mol l-1 for the antibiotic-treated aphids and 0.3 mol l-1 for untreated aphids. These data indicate that the aphid, and not its associated microbiota, mediates the synthesis of oligosaccharides when the osmotic pressure of the ingesta is high.},

Forty-three DMP topics were identified. The review uncovered inconsistent requirements for written DMPs as well as high variability in required or suggested DMP topics among funder requirements. DMP requirements were found to emphasize post-publication data sharing rather than upstream activities that impact data quality, provide traceability or support reproducibility. With the emphasis equalized, the forty-three identified topics can aid Data Managers in systematically generating comprehensive DMPs that support research project planning and funding application evaluation as well as data management conduct and post-publication data sharing.},

The well documented no-analog plant communities of late-glacial North America are closely linked to ``novel'' climates also lacking modern analogs, characterized by high seasonality of temperature. In climate simulations for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A2 and B1 emission scenarios, novel climates arise by 2100 AD, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. These future novel climates are warmer than any present climates globally, with spatially variable shifts in precipitation, and increase the risk of species reshuffling into future no-analog communities and other ecological surprises. Most ecological models are at least partially parameterized from modern observations and so may fail to accurately predict ecological responses to these novel climates. There is an urgent need to test the robustness of ecological models to climate conditions outside modern experience.},

(the common milkweed) was studied by conventional fixation and staining techniques and by osmium impregnation techniques. The mature laticifer protoplast in A. syriaca possesses a large central vacuole with an intact vacuolar membrane. Formation of this vacuole apparently results from dilation and subsequent enlargement of endoplasmic reticulum and possibly in part by fusion of smaller vacuoles and limited cellular-lytic autophagy. Widespread digestion or autophagy of cytoplasm within vacuoles is not evident. Nuclei, mitochondria, dictyosomes, and small vesicles are the most prominent components distributed in the peripheral cytoplasm Plastids appear to degenerate as the laticifer matures. The specialized cellular component, latex, which is the vacuolar content of the laticifer, is interpreted to be produced in the cytoplasm and subsequently incorporated into the large central vacuole. Rubber globules, the most prominent latex component, are surrounded by a membrane that does not have a trilaminate structure. Globules are associated with an electron-dense fibrillar component in the vacuole.}

While direct mortality of wildlife from vehicles has been well documented, fewer studies have focussed on the population-level effects of road mortality, particularly due to low-traffic volume roads. We conducted a population viability analysis (PVA) on western rattlesnakes Crotalus oreganus occupying a protected area with low road density and an average traffic volume of {$\approx$}350 vehicles d-1, near the northern periphery of the species' range. We used the program Vortex with a field-derived database on road mortality, population demography, and extent of occurrence. The model showed that although the population had a high likelihood of persistence over the next 100 yr (extinction probability {$<$}0.01), a substantial decline was projected (stochastic growth rate -0.035, 97\% decrease in mean population size, from 2131 to 72) under the current road mortality rate (6.6\% of population yr-1); any increases in road mortality rates were projected to cause extirpation in under 100 yr. Our study provides strong evidence that road mortality is and will continue to be a significant contributor to the decline of this threatened species, even without higher traffic volumes and other significant anthropogenic impacts.},

Existing overlap indices do not account for the size-/stage-structured nature of these populations. In this paper I present new overlap indices that use information about the sizes of individuals that co-occur in time and space to predict the potential for interactions in size-structured guilds. An index of the opportunity for competition (IOC) calculates the frequency with which similar size classes of two species encounter each other, whereas an index of the opportunity for intraguild predation (IOP) calculates the frequency of encounters among disparate size classes of the same two species. To illustrate that these indices are more appropriate for size-structured populations than conventional indices, I calculated overlap, IOP, and IOC for all species pairs in a diverse assemblage of dragonfly larvae. The new indices revealed size-specific patterns of overlap that were not detected by the conventional index, including that (1) some species with high overlap values should interact mainly as competitors, others mainly as intraguild predators, and many as both competitors and predators, (2) subtle differences in phenology and/or size-specific shifts in habitat distribution can lead to the potential for asymmetric interspecific interactions, (3) some species with low pairwise IOP and IOC values are nonetheless vulnerable to the effects of diffuse competition or intraguild predation, (4) seasonal segregation reduces competitive overlap but at the same time increases the opportunity for intraguild predation. The indices are general in form and should be useful for analyzing distributional data for any size-structured assemblage in which the type and intensity of interaction varies as a function of relative size.},

While temperature is neither static in space nor in time, little work has incorporated spatiotemporal dynamics into community-level investigations of thermal variation. We conducted a microcosm experiment using ciliate protozoa to test the effects of temperatures fluctuating synchronously or asynchronously on communities in two-patch landscapes connected by short or long corridors. We monitored the abundance of each species for 4 weeks---equivalent to 28 generations---measuring the effects of four temperature regimes and two corridor lengths on community diversity and composition. While corridor length significantly altered the trajectory of diversity change in the communities, this did not result in different community structures at the end of the experiment. The type of thermal variation significantly affected both the temporal dynamics of diversity change and final community composition, with synchronous fluctuation causing deterministic extinctions that were consistent across replicates and spatial variation causing the greatest diversity declines. Our results suggest that the presence and type of thermal variation can play an important role in structuring ecological communities, especially when it interacts with dispersal between habitat patches.},

Environmental conditions and access to food resources impact the physiology and fitness of D. suzukii; these factors could also affect dispersal. Flight mills are a convenient tool for measuring and comparing the flight performance of insects. In this study, two experiments examined the effects of diet and humidity on D. suzukii flight performance using custom-built flight mills, and a third experiment compared the energy reserves of D. suzukii flown or not flown on flight mills. Over all flight assays, the median flight distance and duration were 27.16~m and 2.37~min, respectively, and the mean flight velocity was 0.18~m/s. The maximum flight distance and duration by an individual were 1.75~km and 2.35~h, respectively. Drosophila suzukii provisioned with blossoms, fruits, or standard laboratory diets flew farther distances and longer durations than starved flies. While starvation was associated with reduced flight performance, there were no observed differences between diet types. It remains unclear whether D. suzukii consistently use lipids, glycogen, sugar, or another energy source for flight because tethered individuals may not have flown enough to deplete energy reserves. Humidity did not affect flight performance of D. suzukii within a\,{\textasciitilde}\,2~h test period. These data indicate that most D. suzukii are likely to remain within limited area (e.g., within a field) but that some individuals can disperse long distances (field to field spread).},

  abstract = {1 Body-size may be an important feature of the structure of food webs. Detailed food web data are however scarce, particularly those including ontogenetic dietary shifts within species. We examined the predator guild in a well characterized food web, that of Broadstone Stream (UK), to assess the importance of body-size within and among species in relation to intraguild predation and niche overlap. 2 In agreement with recent food web theory, mutual predation and cannibalism were frequent and occurred in many pairwise permutations. This intraguild predation was strongly asymmetric, being determined by relative body-size within and among species, and seasonal `ontogenetic reversals' in trophic status arose when generations overlapped. 3 Predator size determined dietary overlap, with ontogenetic shifts often outweighing taxonomic differences. Small predators had the narrowest diets, regardless of species, and were limited to feeding on a restricted subset of the total prey size-spectrum. Niche overlap decreased as pairwise differences in body-size increased among and within species. Overlap in diet also tracked seasonal changes in resource availability, being highest in summer, when prey were abundant and small, and declining progressively over time, as prey became scarcer and/or larger. The small predators also became more detritivorous as prey abundance declined and the larger prey species attained size-refugia. 4 The body-size constraints driving feeding relationships within the predator guild, in terms of both resource partitioning and intraguild predation, lend support to recent niche models of food web structure (Warren 1996; Williams \& Martinez 2000). The highly interconnected food web of Broadstone Stream appeared to be structured by relatively simple rules, with seasonal and ontogenetic shifts in the size-spectrum accounting for most of the changes in predator diet and trophic position. Encounter rate in time (prey and predator mobility) and space (microhabitat use) and foraging mode also influenced prey vulnerability and niche overlap, but were secondary to the effect of body-size.},

  abstract = {A common assumption historically in ecology is evident in the term "balance of nature." The phrase usually implies that undisturbed nature is ordered and harmonius, and that ecological systems return to a previous equilibrium after disturbances. The more recent concepts of point equilibrium and static stability, which characterize the classical equilibrium paradigm in ecology, are traceable to the assumptions implicit in "balance of nature." The classical equilibrium view, however, has failed not only because equilibrium conditions are rare in nature, but also because of our past inability to incorporate heterogeneity and scale multiplicity into our quantitative expresssions for stability. The theories and models built around these equlibrium and stability principles have misrepresented the foundations of resource management, nature conservation, and environemtnal protection. In this paper, we sysntesize recent developments that advance our understandings of equilibrium vs. nonequilibrium, homogeneity vs. heterogeneity, determinism vs. stochasticity, and single-sclae phenomenon vs. hierarchical linkages in ecological systems. The integration of patch dynamics with hierarchy theory has led to new perspectives in spatial and temporal dynamics, with explicit linkage between scale and heterogeneity. The major elements of the hierarchical patch dynamics paradigm include the idea of nested hirarchies of patch mosaics, ecosystem dynamics as a composite of patch changes in time and space, the pattern-process-scale perspecitve, the nonequilibrium perspective, and the concepts of incorporation and metastability. Both enviromental stochasticities and biotic feedback interactions can cause instability and contribute to the dynamcis observed a various scales. Stabilizing mechanisms that dampen these destabilizing forces include spatial incorporation, environmental disturbances, biological compensatory mechanisms, and heterogeneity absorpion. Hierarchical patch dynamics incorporates certain "emergent properties" of ecological system, such as metastabilityor persistence at the meta-scale, as opposed to the transient dynamics that usually characterize local phenomena. In contrast to the stability that derives from an assumed self-regulation in a closed system, the concepts of incorporation and metastability deal explicity with multiple-scale processes and the consequences of heterogeneity. The most imporatant contribution of hierarchical patch dynamics lies in the framework provided for explicitly incorporating heterogeneity and scale, and for integrating equilibrium, multiple equilibrium, and nonequilibrium perspectives.},

We show that locomotor performance and metabolism influenced individual movement with varying levels of confidence. Range edges differed from cores in traits that may be associated with dispersal success, including metabolism, locomotor performance, corticosterone levels, and immunity, and differences increased with increasing time since separation. Physiological effects were particularly pronounced in birds and amphibians, but taxon-specific differences may reflect biased sampling in the literature, which also focussed primarily on North America, Europe, and Australia. Hence, physiology can influence movement, but undersampling and bias currently limits general conclusions.},

Incorporating abundances into species distribution models may greatly improve model predictive accuracy in practice. Boosted regression trees (BRT) models have been widely used in species distribution modeling, however no ecological study has been conducted to date that has assessed the predictive accuracy of BRT models that incorporates species abundance weights. We compared traditional, unweighted BRTs with species abundance-weighted BRTs for 55 fluvial fish species native to the Northeastern U.S. Overall model deviance explained and six diagnostic measures of predictive performance were compared between traditional BRTs and weighted BRTs. These comparisons indicated that unweighted BRTs performed better for fluvial fish species considered common, including those with greater numbers of presences and higher prevalence. Conversely, weighted BRTs were better suited for modeling distributions of species that had fewer presences, lower prevalence, and higher rarity, indicating the potential of species abundance-weighted distribution modeling to improve results for species of high conservation importance. Last, we offer insights into the applicability of using weighted approaches with other commonly used species distribution modeling methods.},

An outdoor freshwater mesocosm experiment was used to determine how warming of{$\sim$}4 {$^\circ$}C would affect the size, biomass and taxonomic structure of planktonic communities. Warming increased the steepness of the community size spectrum by increasing the prevalence of small organisms, primarily within the phytoplankton assemblage and it also reduced the mean and maximum size of phytoplankton by approximately one order of magnitude. The observed shifts in phytoplankton size structure were reflected in changes in phytoplankton community composition, though zooplankton taxonomic composition was unaffected by warming. Furthermore, warming reduced community biomass and total phytoplankton biomass, although zooplankton biomass was unaffected. This resulted in an increase in the zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio in the warmed mesocosms, which could be explained by faster turnover within the phytoplankton assemblages. Overall, warming shifted the distribution of phytoplankton size towards smaller individuals with rapid turnover and low standing biomass, resulting in a reorganization of the biomass structure of the food webs. These results indicate future environmental warming may have profound effects on the structure and functioning of aquatic communities and ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is native to eastern Asia and was accidentally introduced into North America in 2000. Within a few years, it was found throughout the U.S. and Canadian soybean-growing regions. The spread of A. glycines in North America is partly ascribed to its great flight capacity. We conducted direct measurements of flight performance of winged A. glycines adults and correlated this to their subsequent longevity and fecundity to determine whether there are trade-offs between flight and fecundity. We also estimated fecundity and development time of the offspring of females that had flown varying distances to examine potential maternal effects linked to flight. The experiment was conducted using a specifically designed aphid flight mill system in which winged aphids were tethered by their abdomens and flight duration, distance and speed were quantified. Fecundity, longevity and reproductive periods of 12-h-old A. glycines alates that had engaged in \&gt;0.5 km long flights were significantly lower than those of \&lt;0.5-km individuals. The offspring of alates with flight experiences of \&gt;1.5 km also had lower fecundity than those produced by individuals that had engaged in flights \&lt;1.5 km. Our results are therefore consistent both with direct trade-offs between flight and fecundity and a trade-off between flight and fecundity via maternal effects.},

  abstract = {Bacterial symbionts associated with insects are often involved in host development and ecological adaptation. Serratia symbiotica, a common facultative endosymbiont harbored in pea aphids, improves host fitness and heat tolerance, but studies concerning the nutritional metabolism and impact on the aphid host associated with carrying Serratia are limited. In the current study, we showed that Serratia-infected aphids had a shorter nymphal developmental time and higher body weight than Serratia-free aphids when fed on detached leaves. Genes connecting to fatty acid biosynthesis and elongation were up-regulated in Serratia-infected aphids. Specifically, elevated expression of fatty acid synthase 1 (FASN1) and diacylglycerol-o-acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) could result in accumulation of myristic acid, palmitic acid, linoleic acid, and arachidic acid in fat bodies. Impairing fatty acid synthesis in Serratia-infected pea aphids either by a pharmacological inhibitor or through silencing FASN1 and DGAT2 expression prolonged the nymphal growth period and decreased the aphid body weight. Conversely, supplementation of myristic acid (C14:0) to these aphids restored their normal development and weight gain. Our results indicated that Serratia promoted development and growth of its aphid host through enhancing fatty acid biosynthesis. Our discovery has shed more light on nutritional effects underlying the symbiosis between aphids and facultative endosymbionts.},
